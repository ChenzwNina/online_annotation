Ukraine's boat drones sank a THIRD of the Black Sea Fleet and changed naval warfare forever","shortTitle":"Sea drones: The attack on Kerch Bridge","shortAt":"2024-03-18T15:00:30.000Z","longAt":"2024-03-15T17:00:43.000Z","longTranscript":"Russia's Black Sea Fleet is sinking, faster than ever a third of its ships, have now been sent to the Bottom of the, Sea and while many of them were blown up, by missiles an increasing number are, being taken down using drones in total a, dozen vessels have either been damaged, or sunk by these terrifying little craft, which have also managed to blow a chunk, of Putin's beloved Kirch bridge but, since the start of this year the attacks, have really ramped up with three War war, ships sunk or destroyed within 6 weeks, of each other operated by two shadowy, units within kiev's intelligent Services, they have managed to scare Russia's, Fleet out of its main base in Sebastapol, and send it running to the other side of, the Black Sea that has broken Russia, supply lines opened up a valuable sea, trading route that is helping keep, Ukraine in the fight and possibly Chang, the face of Naval Warfare forever so how, exactly have these attacks been carried, out what do we know about the craft Kev, is using and how is all of that, affecting the war here is everything we, know about Ukraine's killer drone, fleets since the start of the Year, agents of Ukraine's Military, Intelligence have used their mura V5, drones to sink three Russian battleships, those vessels with the avanet missile, Cruiser the Caesar kunov transport ship, and the Sur kotov Patrol booat each of, these attacks has followed a similar and, very successful pattern that is sure to, be repeated in the future first they all, took place at night making the drones, harder to spot and shoot terrifying, footage taken from the deck of the, Caesar kunov as the crew battled the, drones shows just how hard a task this, was sitting low in the water painted, black and moving fast the drones were, extremely difficult ult targets for the, hapless Marines on board to hit they, would have been lucky to take out one or, two but in fact they were attacked by, six, simultaneously second the initial hit on, each warship struck a weak spot designed, to leave it dead in the water in the, case of the kuniko this was the ramp at, the front which is normally used to load, and unload tanks but was turned into a, giant water scoop by the blast for aovet, and C of this was their engines one hit, on the side and the other at the stern, leaving them without, power third multiple follow-up drones, then picked a single point and, repeatedly drove into it each subsequent, explosion borrowing a little further, through the ship's armor this eventually, caused a catastrophic Hull breach, meaning they began taking on water, rolled and then vanished beneath the, waves clearly the Drone pilot PS had, done their research not only did they, know exactly where each of the, battleships were so they could be, attacked they knew exactly where to hit, them to cause maximum damage the, Russians were left with little chance of, saving the ships and unless they can, come up with answers they will lose even, more in the coming, months the mura V5 named after a Slavic, goddess of war is the fifth generation, of Ukrainian sea drones that have been, in service since late 2022 at least they, were developed by the G the country's, Military Intelligence arm headed by, Commando cillo budanov and are piloted, by the shadowy group, 13 the group's Commander himself, codenamed 13 has understandably revealed, little about their inner, workings however we do know quite a lot, about their capabilities after Ukraine, showed them off at an Arms Fair in, Turkey in 2023, each boat is 18 ft long 5 ft wide can, cruise at 25 mph and has a top speed of, 50 mph they have cameras mounted on the, top to allow the pilots to guide them, and are thought to be powered by an, electric motor to reduce their heat, signature and are made of plastic to, reduce their radar cross-section the, suicide variants which were used for the, attacks on the warships are thought to, carry up to 300 kg of explosives Each of, which are activated by fuses mounted in, the nose but other variants used for, surveillance and spying can be mounted, with sophisticated sensors like, gyroscopes laser rangefinders and Marine, Radars a starlink dish mounted on the, back helps keep them in contact with the, shore but they are thought to have, multiple means of communication in case, this is jammed Ukrainian sources say, they are even working on an AI powered, version which can pick its own, targets mura is not the only SE drone in, use by Ukraine either the sbu Ukraine's, equivalent of the Russian FSB has a, craft of its own called the sea baby, whilst it looks the same as the mura it, is actually slower heavier and packs a, bigger wallup carrying almost three, times the amount of explosives for that, reason the seab baby is mostly used, against static targets such as Bridges, and ships in Port unlike the mura which, is Nimble enough to catch them on the, move the seab baby was also deployed, first and was responsible for attacks on, the Black Sea Fleet dating all the way, back to October, 2022 on that occasion seven surface, drones combined with air drones were, used to attack the fleet's main port at, sasta pole in Crimea footage showed the, craft dodging bullets on their way into, the port where they struck and damaged, two, vessels one was the Ivan golubets a mind, sweeping ship and the other was the, frigate Admiral marov hitting the, macarov was a particular propaganda win, for Ukraine because it had recently been, promoted to Flagship of the Black Sea, Fleet after the mosa was, destroyed however the attack failed to, sink either vessel and similar strikes, on five other ships including the even, Kur Olen Gorski gornak and Sig oil, tanker produced the same result damage, but no sinking by far the most, successful attack carried out by a, cabbab was a strike on the Kirch Bridge, the $4 billion connection between Crimea, and Mainland Russia The Raid took place, in July of last year and saw two drones, loaded with a combined, 1,700 kilos of explosives slam into two, of the bridges support, columns the blast destroyed part of the, roadway closing it to Military and, civilian traffic though the more, important Railway which runs parallel, was, undamaged but perhaps the most important, aspect of the attack was as a propaganda, victory for, Ukraine the bridge is a point of Pride, for Putin a huge physical demonstration, of his claim that Crimea rightfully, belongs to Russia and a brag that he was, able to seize it with such ease back in, 2014 for that reason and because it is, important as a military Supply Route it, is extremely heavy, defended the fact that kev's men were, able to knock out the bridge even, temporarily punctures the image of the, Russian military as a supreme force and, it also shows up Putin's imperialist, dreams about retaking Ukrainian, territory as a vulnerable fantasy at, least in the eyes of the people he hopes, one day to rule so what does all of that, mean for the, war well obviously every Russian, Battleship that goes down to the bottom, of the sea is also good for Ukrainian, morale and the morale of its allies, especially since it comes at a, particularly dark moment of the conflict, when there is little good news from the, battlefield not only does it keep public, and political support behind the war, effort but it proves that Ukraine can, still achieve the unthinkable if given, the right kind of support that doesn't, have to mean handing over weapons both, the seab baby and mura are produced, domestically but it does acquire money, and knowhow if Ukraine can prove the, help it is already being given is being, put to good use it encourages allies to, give more help in the future second and, perhaps obviously it is hugely, demoralizing to Russian soldiers and to, the Kremlin, supporters navies tend to be a point of, pride of any armed forces partly because, the sheer size and complexity of, battleships and because of the huge, amount of power they can exert being, unable to protect such Prestige war, machines grinds away at a military, sapping its psychological strength over, time and not just in the Navy either, though the effects here will be, especially acute but in all the services, including among the generals and in the, Kremlin itself case in point Putin is, thought to have sacked the Commander in, charge of the Black Sea Fleet just a few, days ago after losing faith in, him third it is disrupting Russian, supply lines and fourth it has allowed, Ukraine to reopen trading routes which, are a vital economic Lifeline in 2022, When The War Began Ukraine had just one, Battleship which wasn't even functional, as it was undergoing repairs and was, quickly scuffled in Port at MV to stop, Russia capturing it that left KV with no, Navy at all meaning Russian warships and, submarines could roam the Black Sea at, will blockading Ukrainian ports and, firing missiles at its cities it also, meant that Russian Supply ships could, move freely bringing much needed weapons, from the mainland and oil from Syria but, since the Drone attacks began Russia's, ships have been pushed back from the, coast allowing Ukrainian ports to, reopen that means grain exports a, Lifeline for the country's War torn, economy have restarted helping keep Kiev, in the fight in the last few months, Russian ships have been pushed back even, further and have now mostly abandoned, their home Port of sevastopol for the, Russian Coast the vast majority of the, Black Sea Fleet is now based at Novo, rosis meaning large parts of Ukraine are, outside of Missile Range and ships which, used to travel from Syria to the front, lines are no longer able to instead they, have to sail via the med to the Baltic, Sea and then to, Russia this adds thousands of miles and, many days to the journey slowing down, the speed of supplies and thus the speed, at which the Russian army can advance, Fifth and finally Ukraine's success in, syncing even some of Russia's most, modern warships with a few drones may, change the way Naval Wars are fought, forever before Naval Supremacy was, available only to the handful of, countries which had the money and, Technology to build and maintain huge, warships and fleets like America's, aircraft carriers and their carrier, strike groups but now ships worth tens, of millions of dollars can be sunk by, drones worth a fraction of that meaning, even the tiniest of countries can fight, and secure their coastlines without a, doubt every Naval College in the world, will be studying the footage of these, Ukrainian drone attacks very carefully, and trying to come up with ways to stop, them just as sure as every nation with a, coastline and a small budget will be, looking to buy or build drones of their, own 2 years into this war War it is, tempting to believe that Ukraine has no, more surprises up its, sleeve they stunned the world just by, surviving Russia's initial Onslaught and, then continued to defy the odds as they, took back territory and inflicted huge, losses the failure of last Summer's, offensive seemed to indicate they had, finally hit their limit there really, were things that the world's pluckiest, underdogs could not do but the massacre, of Russian sea power currently taking, place in the Black Sea proves otherwise, it Remains the case that a small but, motivated and well supported military, that knows its business can and will, beat a larger and less well-prepared, opponent there are many who would like, to write Ukraine off as a lost cause but, they need look no further than the, waters around Crimea to see why Kiev is, a long way from being, done","shortTranscript":"the most successful attack carried out, by a seab bab was a strike on the Kirch, Bridge the $4 billion connection between, Crimea and Mainland Russia The Raid

like that. We \nkind of check our egos in that way. Like we  , don't we're not we're actually just very \nnot competitive in that way at all. Like  , kind of like Wham! in that way \n- there's a great documentary., I feel like, you know, there's never any  , sort of a hard and fast rule for creative stuff, \nright? Like, it's it's really up to the artists  , and it's up to us to sort out you know how we're \ngoing to make the record. You know, logistically,  , how we're going to do it, how we're going to \npay for it, how we're going to make it happen,  , how we're going to find the time for the other \nthings in our lives. Like it's not necessarily  , a given thing, like a regular job. It's something \nI think every time you have to sort of re commit  , and make it happen and and find the time and find \nthe resources. So I think it's every single time  , we make a record, I feel like it's you kind of \nhave to recommit to that and find the connection  , to it and the importance of it again, in order \nto to really dig in and and make it happen., Yeah, you have to get to a place where you it \nfeels like an imperative and compulsory. And once  , you get there, then it kind of opens up for you. \nBut I think when you have finished an album cycle  , and you're like dipping back into that creative \nwell like the the worry is like, well, what is  , there? Like, what will we find? And it, you \nknow, it takes exploration and patience and  , and grit. But you don't necessarily know \nwhat's inside of that being, I guess,  , until you get in there. It's always a little \nscary to restart, but there's there's a loose  , conversation, but there's never like a formal \nconversation. It's just a continual conversation., I mean, I feel like we are kind of  , in general, sort of always writing. \nWe try and keep ideas sort of going.  , But I think after we sort of came off of 'Path of \nWellness,' we were we were kind of playing with  , some different ideas. And I think. Probably one \nof the first things we did was Untidy Creature., Yeah, I had that riff, that opening riff \nand. Yeah, we just we we kept returning to  , that song. We kind of worked on it, but there \nwas a lot of especially Corin and had so many  , doubts about that song, which is a common theme \nin terms of the writing of this record is sort of  , having a lot of questions about songs that \nended up becoming such certainties. But  , that was kind of when that began, and that was \nactually probably the end of 2021. And that was  , yeah, that was a while ago. And \nthen we were working on it for  , quite a while. We had early thought we \nhad Needlessly Wild. That was there. , Crusader.\nOr Crusader, Say it Like You mean It like we were.  , A lot of the album was already kind of being \ndeveloped and we knew. I don't know. We knew  , we we had something, but it kind of didn't \nfully take shape, I think, until probably,  , you know, the middle of or early part of 2020 \nto spring 2022, we really thought like, okay,  , we we were getting close to like having a \nnew record and we really love these songs. , I read that Untidy Creatures almost didn't make \nthe album. Is that because of this reservation? , Almost none of those songs made the album. \nI didn't want to put Say it like you mean  , it. Which is shocking. I didn't want to. I just I \ndon't know. It's I don't know how to describe it,  , but it's. It just felt very vulnerable and felt \nvery like almost overly emotional. You know,  , and I don't know, it just it seemed kind of like \npeople don't want to hear that it's over the top,  , you know? I disagree. And yeah, and so it's it \ntook me a long time to really realize, like,  , well, that's just what this record is. It's really \nraw. And that's kind of what was sort of pulling  , it all together in a way.\nMm hmm. , Yeah, I mean, we've been talking to John \nCongleton since No Cities to Love. Like  , we you know, he almost produced that. \nAnd then I think we even talked to him  , maybe at the center before Center won't hold \nbefore we work with Annie. It's just been. , We've just known each other for a long \ntime. Yeah, thinking about it for a long  , time. Yeah. It just kind of, like, clicked \nand schedules worked, and the material,  , I think, was really suited to what he does.\nYeah. And John, I think he's a good producer  , for us because he understands the lexicon, like \nthe musical lexicon of Sleater-Kinney. Like,  , he's not in there to just, like, dissemble it. He. \nBut he really knows how to bring out performances  , from us. He was really good with, with rhythm and, \nyou know, like thinking about, like, drums. And  , yeah, he just we just share such a musical \nlanguage. You know, he was on he was in a band  , that was on Kill Rock Stars. Like, we just have \nthis long history. So even just this ongoing kind  , of like dialog that we had that was like both very \nearnest and also very absurd was really fun in the  , studio. And he's just he's a good hang and he I \nfeel like this record challenged him and excited  , him and we felt mutually excited about what was \nwhat he was bringing to it. But yeah, we came in  , already with the compositions and the arrangements \nand he just was really good at like figuring out  , how to make like bring out the best of these songs \nand the best of like the playing and the singing., Yeah. Hell is an interesting song because I feel \nlike this song is one of those that came to me  , and was like, Hello. I am a song that you need \nto write. Like I was literally in a record store  , listening to music and wandering \naround and sometimes a song  , sort of rings your doorbell. That's what Kristin \nHersh talks about songwriting and you actually  , like it comes to you and it's like, you need \nto write this. This is something that. It just  , arrives. And it was really important and I felt \nlike it was talking about a bunch of different  , things that have been going on. But it did it in \nsuch a way that was dropping us in a place and a  , time and a feeling and an emotion of. Helplessness \nand frustration and revelation of just, you know,  , how much how much control we had sort of \nconceded at that present moment in time. And so  , I literally started to like writing all the \nlyrics into my phone and had all these ideas and,  , you know, came up with a sort of melody with two \ndifferent melodies for it. And I was like, This is  , super weird. This is again, I was like, This isn't \ngoing to go on the album. It's just something that  , came into my head, you know? But I think, you \nknow, when we started working on it, it became.  , You know, almost like. A symbol of like \nI saying like recognizing how sort of.  , Deeply in crisis. We are right as human beings, \nas the planet, in terms of the violence in  , our culture. Like it's I think it's pretty \nspecific to America and to who we are. It's not  , about religion. It's about a feeling of. You know, \nthat we've we've conceded all these different  , things without really thinking it through. I \nthink and so, you know, I didn't expect people  , to respond to it. And Kerry was like, oh, no, it's \ngreat. And I was like, Really? It's such a weird  , song. But and John Congleton also was like, Yeah, \ngreat, let's do it, you know? So it was just it  , kind of suited the, like I said, the drama of this \nrecord and the and the, you know, the chaos we've  , been through for the past however many years. \nLike, I just it relates to all of that, I think.\" , Yeah. And I think it's a good opener because for \nme at least, like this idea of how I feel like  , there's sort of a freedom of being like, okay, \nwell we've we're living and it's not just like  , cultural and societal stuff. It's, it's like the \npersonal, like turmoil of living, of, like feeling  , feelings that are dark and despairing and like, \nokay, well, if we just reframe, if we start stop,  , like reaching for these, like halcyon, like \nutopian moments and we just acknowledge that  , we're all kind of living in this inverse landscape \nof, of darkness and of uncertainty, then, wow,  , like, we're all welcome here. Like that is there \nis a freedom in that. So to me, like it felt, I  , think as an opener, it sort of like, oh yes, we're \nhere. Like, come in. Like, let's. Let's get in it.  , You know, and so that to me is always a good \nopener, is like, come inside this world, like.  , And it's going to be pretty loud and and with \nmoments of like quiet and beauty and fragility.\", I think there's simply an excellent exploration \nof the liminal, you know, of sort of  , being between two states of like, you \nknow, joy and grief or alive and dead.  , Halo, you know, like the album cover or, you \nknow, sort of in a doorway on a precipice like  , this idea of precarity. And I think that \nhas a religious quality to it like this,  , this questioning and wondering about what happens \nnext and what came before. And I think that,  , like there is a thread of that. And in a lot \nof these songs, for sure, I will say that,  , you know, a lot of these songs were written before \nI lost my mom and but it was her death informed  , the process as much as it informed like the \nactual content of the songs. Because I sort of,  , you know, like, I think this is probably the first \nrecord in a really long time that Corin does the  , lion's share of the singing. And it's a different \nkind of singing. It's a singing. I haven't really  , heard from Corin and since maybe like The Woods \nor something. And so it's interesting to hear  , you say, like, I feel so vulnerable singing like \nthat because it has been a while. But, you know,  , I really needed to hear Corin's voice. Like, so \nmuch of the grief was returning to what I needed.  , You know what - where I found comfort. And to me \nit was like, Well, I can work, I can work on this,  , and I'll write songs and play guitar or that. I \njust need you to sing. And so I think a lot of  , the sonic like quality in the \nway she's singing on the record,  , it was part of that conversation \nbetween the two of us., It definitely was like an evolving process. Like, \nwell, for instance, say it like, you mean it was  , a song that, you know, I had the idea for, but it \nwas much tamer in the original demo for the song,  , you know, and we were kind of trying it \nin the studio and playing with it. And  , it wasn't it wasn't coming out in a way \nthat sort of matched the emotional quality  , of the rest of the songs. And John was like, \nWe're not there, you know? And I was like,  , What do you mean? Like, I really it was very, \nvery frustrating. And so I turned around and  , came back the next day and I had like rewritten \nthe melody. So it was really emotional, you know,  , and that that was just like what needed to \nhappen. It's like everything just got sort  , of pushed up to this other level of feeling \nlike, you know, there was like a crisis that  , was happening and and the singing reflected that \nand the music reflected it. And and it all kind  , of like drew things together in a way that kind \nof made that the quality of it very heightened., It's like all the songs and even the ones \nthat we had written before the accident,  , we're all dragged into the hellscape \nreally of of that emotion, you know,  , So it's like I can and that's when the \nsongs kind of became the fully realized  , versions of the songs, when they all sort \nof ended up at this like dark finish line., I think it's it's it is I mean, it's very silly \nof this idea of little rope, but it is like the  , sort of push and pull of like. Okay, well, we'll \ntry it this way and then it'll feel kind of over  , the top. Like with untidy creature. I was like, \nWell, that's not going on the album. Like, it's  , just so you know, it just feels like, you know, \nlike this really, like stadium kind of singing,  , you know, that just feels silly, but also is \nlike, it's so physically rewarding to do it,  , you know what I mean? Like, so there is this \nkind of like push and pull, I think, in terms of,  , you know, where we're going, what we feel like \nwould would suit the record. And, and it is it's,  , you know, I think when you're younger, you \nknow, you you kind of have this idea in your  , mind. You're like, okay, I wrote this song. It's \ngreat. It's going to go exactly like this in the  , studio. And then you realize that maybe that's \nlet's not always first say the best idea. It's  , like you as you get older, you're willing to \ntry a bunch of different things and be like,  , Okay, maybe that wasn't the best way to do \nit. Maybe I'll try it this way and maybe we'll  , rearrange this part, you know? And I think \nthat helps you grow as a writer, you know?, Uh, I mean, I think I just just need, you know, \nand I think music, to me, is a ritual that is  , very sacred and thus very close to prayer. You \nknow, there is something prayerful about the  , choreography of returning to guitar or singing. \nAnd so I think it's actually a very natural,  , like probably age old way of of processing \nsorrow. You know, song and the way that,  , you know, that takes whatever is inside of you \nand puts it into the room, you know, where you can  , cry with it or find joy in it or, you know, \njust sit with it. So that like interiority  , versus like the exterior already, I guess, of \nof playing music is really important, I think,  , for just the process of living with with grief. \nSo, yeah, I mean, I for me, I returned to guitar.  , You know, I just I would play all the time. Corin \nwould send me demos of and, and songs and I would  , just be like, okay, well here is I added this \npart, and here I'm just playing and playing and I  , just needed to, you know, feel like my fingers on \nsomething that was solid. Like I, you know, when  , people leave this earth, like you're aware of what \nis still here and what is still tactile versus  , what you'll never touch again. So, yeah., Yeah. I mean, I think I think that's like, you \nknow, it's kind of part of the deal when you're  , an artist. In some ways, it's like. You know, \nyou just it's you kind of have to open that  , door. And it's uncomfortable sometimes, you know, \nBut it's also, like, just so necessary and it's so  , integral, right, to the relationship between \nyourself and your audience. And that's something  , that we are. So I think fortunate to have \nis right is like the lie of the moment of.  , Playing those songs for people who are \nstanding in front of us is like, for me,  , that's like the core of what we do and that's like \na core moment of like that shared moment that is,  , you know, like Bruce Springsteen said, you \nhave your religion, I've got mine. You know,  , it's like that, that moment when I'm in an \naudience for someone like that or I'm sharing  , that with an audience member as an artist \nis like, it's really special and it's really  , precious. And so you know that it kind of \nis the how is like you kind of crack that  , open and you are willing to go there and \nthe audience is willing to go there with  , you. And that moment is that's sort of like \nthe transcendent moment where you you're both  , giving and gaining. I think when you kind of \nshare those like personal things in your songs., And Sleater-Kinney, I think has always been a band \nthat is a container for our vulnerabilities and  , you know what we're living through and going \nthrough. Like it's always been a reflection  , of that. I think we've always written from a \nplace of honesty and transparency, but also  , songs aren't static or something that is written \nin in a place of pain, you know, can eventually  , be sung enough that it has nothing \nto do with that anymore, you know,  , that it takes the same experience, the same words, \nand makes them, you know, about something else,  , like something that's that's elevated and and \nblissful or just it just changes. It's, you know,  , it mutates. And that's what's so great about all \nthe songs. I mean, we have so many songs that come  , from a place of strife or anger and and then they \njust sound triumphant after a while. And that,  , I think, is like the beauty of sharing music with \npeople, that you're meeting them where they're at.  , And they yes, they might also be grieving or they \nmight be having the best night of their lives, and  , suddenly the song is just helping them celebrate \nsomething like it's it's just very fluid. And  , I, I really love that about it \nand I appreciate it. So. Yeah., Honestly, it really the songs \nchanged so much, you know, and.  , And and there was like so much fluidity to \nthe process and like what we thought was  , going to make sense being on an album, \nI really didn't think that people were  , going to be like, Oh yeah, how's going \non the album? Like, it's like an idea.\", This is news to me. This is like, there's so \nmany. Yeah, but this is the common thread with  , this record. Yeah, it's like Hell, say it like \nyou mean it, which when Corin sent me that song I  , played it. She didn't even have verse, \nlyrics or melody. The verses were blank.  , And then she had a chorus and I already was \nlistening to it over and over. I'm like,  , Wow, this just is like sound. It's already sounds \nlike a classic. Like there's something so classic  , about the song. So that's funny to me. I do think \nthere might be a song that unlocked that though,  , but it definitely wasn't any of those songs.  , Yeah, I don't know. I actually do think that \nyou're maybe you're right. Maybe the story of  , this record is that we like that there was - \nit's sort of about uncertainty. And there was  , there was a lack. I actually think it's amazing \nto be this far along in our career and like,  , be writing these songs and be like, we don't \nwe don't know. Like, we just don't know if  , this - is which is a nice feeling. That's how \nyou sometimes feel when you're just starting out., It was somewhere around Hunt YouDown. \nThat was like I think there were there  , was a handful of songs we wrote around that song  , that I thought, like, okay, yeah, we're \nwe're getting we're getting there., I feel like, don't feel right. It \nwas really important. But that also  , was one where it almost didn't go on the record., Yeah, it. Don't feel right you down there were \ncertain ones. Yeah that I think that was like a  , really fruitful writing period for us. Like \nwe had already recorded four of the songs  , and then we had this big break and we were \ntwo and we wrote like a handful more songs.  , And those two, I think we're like, okay, this \nis like we just kept saying, like, we need  , we need faster songs, faster, faster. Like \nit just, yeah, there was an urgency that I  , think those songs brought that we thought, \nokay, that those are those like hell sounds  , urgent in a different way and tidy creature sounds \nurgent. You know, honestly, that restlessness and  , urgency is throughout the record, but \nthose have this like sonic kind of  , urgency to them that I think made us feel like, \nokay, we're getting there, We're getting there., That is a song I think about depression and \ndespondency and actually was written before  , the accident. That's like before the accident, \nafter the accident songs. And it's weird because  , it then felt like it was like prescient in this \nway. That was kind of devastating. But yeah, it  , is just about that. I mean, yes, it, it obviously \nconjures some of those negative thoughts, but it's  , also about like steeling yourself against those \nvery things and kind of facing it, I guess. But  , yeah, it's it's also just about asking people in \nyour life and yourself to just sort of reckon with  , that melancholy, you know. And yeah, like that \nfirst line, you know, dress yourself, get up,  , girl, and dress yourself and clothes \nyou love for a world you hate. Like,  , to me, like, that's like so many days, you \nknow, you're just like. Like that weird,  , just juxtaposition of just like, what you present \nversus what you feel inside to me is like -  , it is the present era. So yeah, it's a little \nbit of a rallying cry for that exact feeling., I feel like Untidy Creature was definitely just \nlike I heard that that riff that Carrie had on  , guitar, and it was like, okay, let's go. Like, I \nfeel like there's a song and I wanted to sing it  , just like that, kind of like that Sleater-Kinney \nthing where she plays guitar and I'm like,  , I know I can sing over that. And we did it. \nAnd then I was like, Well, that was done. Like,  , we're not putting that on the record. Like, it \nwas just, it was like, I don't know what it was,  , but there was this kind of like immediate, like \nemotional thing that happened. And then as you get  , older, you kind of want to like, be sort of like \nmore buttoned up as a human being. But that's not  , really what music is, you know? So there was \nkind of like, this is push and pull with it., Music is a constant unbuttoning. \nIt kind of is. Yeah., See, for me, like Hell was a song \nthat totally was obvious. Like,  , that was like it was so obvious \nand so, like, distinct and like,  , unimpeachable and Needlessly Wild - I \nthink also it was just kind of there. Yeah., Fully formed. Yeah. That one was, that was an \nearly one too, where I was like, the song rules., Yeah. So there were I mean, there were definitely \nthings I think though, that the longer you've  , been doing this, you, you do doubt the ones that \nfeel easy sometimes you're like, wait a second,  , we haven't edited this enough and we haven't \nlabored over this. So it's tricky to sort of fall,  , fall in love with things early on because, you \nknow, it it feels like it shouldn't be easy. But  , but some songs are, you know, to Corrin's point, \nlike they feel like they you're just kind of  , pulling them out of the ether as like, gifts. \nAnd then the other stuff is very belabored., Yeah, actually we yeah, we have four no, \nthree songs that we are actually two out  , of the three of those we really we really love. \nAnd then there were a lot of things that made  , it to like almost there we we tend to over right \nnow and which I think is good you know it's not  , like here's the only ten songs we have it's \nI think it's better to be deliberate and I  , think we knew we wanted ten - like the way we just \nwanted that even number five and five, even though  , people don't necessarily think of albums anymore, \nlike there was just something succinct about it.  , Get in, get out, get out. And so sequencing, I \nthink there was at least one other song almost two  , that we were like, Well, these I think could be on \nthe record, but they just make it less succinct., I do hope to hear them one day, but ..\nNo. They'll be out there. We will  , release. We will release them., Yeah, I mean, I think I think each record that \nwe do is its own process and its own world.  , And I think, you know, the thing about \nworking with Janet for so many years is like,  , she's so talented and she was so good at arranging \nand sequencing that, you know, I think sometimes  , we would even think about that when we were \nworking on the record and thinking about like,  , well, you know, maybe what would what would Janet \nhave thought here? You know what I mean? Like,  , because we worked together for so long. So but \nthis record was its own process. Like I said,  , it was very, you know, back and forth between the \ntwo of us and trying different things. And then.  , You know, our relationship and everything \nthat had happened just really influenced  , us. So it was like we really felt like \nwe needed to rely on each other. And  , that's kind of what amplified the \nemotions, I think, on the record., Yeah, I mean, I think we were drawing from all \nareas of the writing for us because, you know,  , even Dig Me out was Corrin and I just writing on \nguitar and, you know, Corrin said there were times  , we would kind of jam out a song with Janet. So, \nyeah, we sort of know now many ways in which to  , write, but this one also felt familiar and, and \nlike the last couple we did, we sat in a room  , with each other playing guitar a lot. And that \nis a very familiar feeling and a good feeling.  , And it's not always doesn't always bring us the \nbest work, but it's it's a way that we connect  , and it's a way that we that we know, you know, \nit's something that feels very, very familiar., I think that we as personalities, like we just \nkind of want to push to make something better and,  , you know, and and do it in a kind way, but say \nlike, hey, you know, I feel like this song,  , maybe it could go a little further here, \nor maybe we need to work on this. You know,  , it is that it's that confidence to say, like, \nwhat if we try this? What about this? You know,  , and then being able to say, like, actually now \nI think we had it at this version of the chorus,  , you know, like we've just done it long enough \nthat we can we can try those things and we can,  , you know, don't be so uptight about like \ntrying something different and then going  , back to like this other version that you \nhad that you think worked better, you know?, Yeah. I think ultimately we can be vulnerable \nwith each other. I mean, it is such a vulnerable  , process to whether you're sitting in playing \nsomething for someone or singing something for  , the first time. You know, we'll always be like \nused to the melody. You know, you do this like  , we just we tossed that back and forth and it you \nhave to trust that the other person is not going  , to basically laugh at your idea. You know that. \nAnd we know how to sort of. Like kindly critique  , each other's work and how to pivot from something \nand how to make suggestions. But I think we always  , have the bigger picture in mind, which is like, \nwe want to make a great record like that. We  , kind of check our egos in that way. Like we don't \nwe're not we're actually just very not competitive  , in that way at all. Like kind of like Wham! in \nthat way. There's a great documentary. But like,  , it's it's I mean, everyone brings ego, but like, \nwe know, I think when the other person has it,  , like we're like you you have that. That's that's \nright. So you just you kind of have to just take  , your lumps. And we're just better at communicating \nprobably than we've ever been. It just happens.","shortTranscript":"I think you know when we started working, on it it, became um you know almost like a symbol, of like I saying like a recognizing you, know how sort, of deeply um

laugh at whether, you agreed with it or not and he does, this whole shtick and I've played it on, radio several times where he talks about, the Liberals and the soall, environmentalists and he despises them, calls them, self-righteous like somehow if we don't, produce Plastics or we don't, recycle or we use gasoline that we're, going to kill the, planet and his bottom line is no we're, not we're like fleas on the back of this, planet we can't harm this planet if we, wanted, to but the planet's going to devour us, like it devoured the dinosaurs, like it devoured in Pompei the people, there the planet will do whatever the, hell the planet wants and it's, completely out of our control and the, idea that mortal beings that human, beings that don't understand one, billionth of 1% of how the universe, works is going to save the planet Earth, is, preposterous I'll give you another, example the Earth obviously is a round, sphere and here's the surface of the, Earth we talk about drilling for oil we, talk about mining here's this, Earth the surface of the, Earth is, a Monumental fraction of the, earth the earth has many, layers we couldn't cut into any, significant way into the Earth if we, wanted to we don't have the capacity to, do it we don't have the knowhow to do it, you know you talk about going down, thousands of feet maybe even a mile, maybe even two that is

beings plants don't live off, pollution they die from pollution carbon, dioxide is a nutrient to plants plants, use carbon dioxide and they create, oxygen we have the symbiotic, relationship with plant life they give, us sustenance oxygen we give them, sustenance carbon dioxide not carbon, monoxide carbon, dioxide well we need to control carbon, dioxide you exhale carbon dioxide, time now how do they intend to control, it they come up with these lies about, how they can control it well it's the, automobiles the, problem the automobiles the problem Oh, yes yes, yes well there weren't automobiles when, there were dinosaurs how did they die, well we don't know but you, know carbon dioxide in the 1970s we, wanted more carbon dioxide why because, they said the Amazon was, dying um 1970s they said the Earth was, freezing 1980s they said the Earth is, overheating uh and on and on on on, science this isn't science it's politics, and when you politicize science you get, bad results

if you needed it I said I'm, writing the book you get to read, it which is pretty much what he did, page after page after page of news, accounts What global warming is doing to, the country, hilariously, absurd one year it's doing this one year, it's doing the opposite of this one year, it's killing the ice cap next year it's, creating the ice cap killing the polar, bears there's more polar bears than ever, before it goes on and on and on the, media know nothing the politicians know, nothing the scientists think they know, everything because they get grants to, promote climate change or global warming, at the time, why well look it empowers, government if you say you have the, ability to control the air and control, the water if you say you have the, ability to control nature if you say you, have the ability to control hurricanes, and earthquakes and floods and all the, rest of it if only you and me would give, up more of our freedom we give up our, cars we give up our single family homes, if we would only do, x y z AB, C then we'd be living in effectively a, paradise where all these things wouldn't, be, happening and so individualism, capitalism, Prosperity economic, growth well they create pollution, they're killing the planet they're, killing our fellow human, beings that's why they Embrace climate, change carbon dioxide, let me put it to you this, way carbon, dioxide if carbon dioxide all if all the, atmosphere in the world could be put in, a, stadium let's say if, 10,000 fans 10,000 chairs in the stadium, carbon dioxide would amount to four, chairs four seats at a 10,000 four seats, the, greatest element in the, atmosphere anybody know what it, is it's, water water water evaporates where does, it go into the, atmosphere water makes up the vast, majority of our atmosphere not all of it, the vast majority carbon, dioxide but you can't, control you can't even measure the, amount of water that's in the atmosphere, what are you going to, do when water evaporates on Earth you, know rains it gets hot the water, evaporates you can't really control that, can you what are you going to do nothing, but carbon, dioxide which you can't really control, either but it comes out of the, Industrial Revolution comes out of, capitalism it comes out of, production comes out of animals and, human, beings therefore if you want to control, you and, me you come up with schemes and plots to, control carbon, dioxide carbon dioxide is not a, pollutant carbon dioxide wasn't even on, the list of pollutants when they passed, the Clean Air, Act carbon dioxide's treated as a, pollutant as a result of a Supreme Court, decision 5 to4 in Massachusetts versus, the, EPA, and one Justice who wrote the, decision while not saying it was a, pollutant said that under the Clean Air, Act the government had the ability or, the legal ability to regulate, it he just said something that is not, true but a 54 decision I guess makes it, true and, lawful and from that point forward, there's been in this effort to control, carbon, dioxide which means control your, life to destroy cars the combustion, engine fossil, fuels single family, homes uh to destroy, livestock that proposal is out there in, other words to fundamentally alter how a, free people live and choose to live and, so government now can dictate more dense, housing more public trans,

to a dangerous start, because of powerful rip currents in, Atlantic and Gulf Coast beaches at least, six people drowned over a recent two-day, period in Florida and North Carolina, lifeguards have rescued more than 150, people over the past week the fast, moving water can surprise even, experienced swimmers our Nancy chin is, on Rockaway Beach here in New York to, show us how to avoid rip currents and, what to do if you're actually caught in, one Nancy good, morning Nate good morning this is the, beach where two teens disappeared into, the water a week ago today a reminder of, how dangerous the surf can be and with, so many of us hitting the shore next, week for July 4th we learned some tips, to keep you and your family safe this, summer with their toes in the surf and, chairs in the sand beachgoers might not, be aware of a hidden danger lurking in, the water rip currents why are rip, currents so dangerous they're dangerous, because they can be deceiving number, danor is the chief lifeguard and Beach, safety manager in Long Branch New Jersey, you can't always see him um especially, if you're not sure what to look for in, terms of all the dangers that you and, your team are looking out for on the, beach where do rip currents rank they, ranked number one last year we had 1,200, rescues rip CS are among the most common, beach hazards and can pop up on even the, nicest days when waves are just 2 to 3, ft high they can be faster than an, Olympic swimmer and are the third, leading po C of weather depths killing, more people on average than hurricanes, tornadoes or lightning a rip current is, formed after waves crash on Shore and, encounter an obstacle in the Beach's, topography including low spots in sand, bars or around peers on the way back out, to the Open Water the fast moving, channels can flow as quickly as 8 ft per, second and account for 80% of lifeguard, rescues on the beach rip currents are, often times one of the main reasons why, we're going in for rescues it's, lifeguard and Nia Garner's fifth summer, watching over this Coastline it's, absolutely gorgeous around us right now, but a rip current could pop up even now, absolutely yeah so often times people, think that rip currents only pop up, during crazy storms but even a day like, this today where the water's pretty flat, rip currents can be anywhere how do you, spot one so it's actually quite simple, often times you're able to see a, swirling in the water and often times a, discoloration or like a a murkiness to, the water you'll often times see that, there aren't any waves particularly, during a day where there are waves then, it was time to get in the water for, Garner to show us how to escape danger, firsthand you showed us how to spot a, rip current what do you do if you're, actually in one now if you're in a rip, current the number one thing to do is, remain calm rip currents are essentially, channels of really quick moving water, that will push you out the sea so if, you're in one you want to remain calm, let the water take you back so if we, were in a rip current right now what, would we do the number one thing you do, is first wave to the LIF guard just like, this and then you want to swim parallel, to, shore tip so a day in the ocean really, can be a walk on the, beach also good to remember that not all, rip currants are the same size and can, range between 50 to 100 ft wide so if, you are caught in a rip current make, sure to keep swimming parallel to shore, until you stop feeling the pull of the, water and they always remember also to, swim near a lifeguard, helpful tips Nancy thank you","shortTranscript":"you showed us how to spot a rip current, what do you do if you're actually in one, now if you're in a rip current the, number one

to the uplift we got a, great show for you a great cast of, characters as well among them these a, doctor who specializes in helping people, with traumatic injuries because that's, something he can relate to also and a, man so dedicated to his job he walks 2, hours to get there every single day in, the community who rallied behind him, also a group that will clean your pool, for free asking one simple favor in, return and a man with a profession who, uses his Charisma to spread Joy boy you, want to know where he works well it's, for a big name in Hollywood also a, basketball star who made it to the NBA, but still has his sight set on another, career all of that and more heartwarming, news you're watching The, [Music], Uplift hey there I'm T deople this is, the uplift the show that lifts you up, for at least the next 30 minutes you and, I like to say me as well and we're going, to be in here a doctor dedicated to, helping others with catastrophic, injuries because he knows exactly what, they're going through here's Mark stman, squeeze my hand for me squeeze in, squeeze in good in a world of noisy, naysayers Woody Morgan represents, possibility it set the bar super high, here uh for what kind of care patients, receive we can definitely do this is, Atlanta shepherd center a premier, facility for patients with brain and, spinal cord trauma in this space, Morgan's often mistaken for a patient, what you're my doctor are you really in, the chair or I've had people say is that, chair for me you know I'm like no no no, this one's mine a swimming accident in, 2008 left Morgan a broken man he was 20, a Premed Collegiate soccer player dop, into a wave and probably hit a sandbar, or the wave crashed just the wrong way, and hit my head down do you remember, feeling anything no I was out so I lost, Consciousness next thing I know I was in, a hospital room two broken vertebrae in, his neck a catastrophic injury leaving, him paralyzed from the chest down Morgan, spent months as a patient at Shephard, reconciling himself to the unthinkable, this athlete would never walk again, early on it was rough and was it hard, for you to wrap your head around that I, would say certainly a good year or two, before um you know feel solidly, comfortable living life in a chair and, with with an injury like this you're, told you might want to rethink that med, school dream yeah in so many words yeah, like all right well I'm going to get, through this I'm going to show you how, to do it in 2015 he graduated in a, wheelchair from Tain Medical School his, specialty rehabbing patients grappling, with the sort of catastrophic injury he, had but we use this to put the pads on, specific muscles and in 2023 then 35, years old he returned to Shepherd over, the years I must have seen hundreds of, patients is's the only one that we have, gotten to come back as a doctors Dr John, Lynn Shepherd's director of spinal cord, medicine remembers treating Morgan 16, years ago did you feel in your gut that, he would actually go to medical school I, didn't think so most because I have, heard so many people said they were, going to do it and they never make it, there I never thought he was going to, actually do it because this is not a, easy injury to overcome but Morgan, remembers seeing Lynn his doctor also, per ized in a wheelchair because of his, own medical condition first time you saw, him surprised certainly was more like an, aha moment motivating yes certainly, motivating so and we both started from, scratch and that's a difficult Journey, not only difficult improbable can you, squeeze his fingers in that's good Woody, Morgan shepher staff physician this is, where you always wanted to end up yeah, yeah that was always the goal having, been a patient makes you a better, physician I would agree with that yeah, just have a lot more empathy there we go, got it and a remarkable backstory I, think it shows you that life is not over, people can get back to driving people, can get back to working people can get, back to bring parents and raising kids, Woody Morgan wheelchair and all proof, that no dream is broken Beyond, repair it's a lovely piece mark thank, you Steve Hartman recently met a man so, dedicated to his job he walks 5 miles, every day just to get there then a local, group decided to become dedicated to him, in Cabin Arkansas just as the sun begins, to set over the local Walmart store, janitor Bill magoi begins walking to, work for his overnight shift he will, track 5 miles 2 hours in any weather, pouring rain you're walking 2 hours each, way yeah I don't call out I want to work, he's going to go to work no matter what, snow snow I picked him up at 9° the, other morning let's go a couple years, ago Christy Conrad saw Bill out walking, and offered him a ride she got to know, him learned about his daunting daily, commute and how he's also legally blind, so she began driving him whenever she, could at least that's how it started why, did you feel the need to do, more I can't be always there, you know so what was your plan Mr Bill's, Village Mr Bill's Village is a Facebook, group chrisy started a couple months ago, she was hoping to find just a few, volunteers to keep an eye out for Bill, when he's walking and within days it, exploded it caught on really quick and, now it's like everyone's competing to, give Mr Bill a ride they'll click and, see is Mr Bill out walking as he headed, to town so people are just driving, around the streets looking for him, pretty much just like where's Waldo but, where's Mr Bill, yeah it's nice to see today the group, has 1,500 members in fact Here Comes one, now hey Mr Bill do you need a ride to, Walmart Oh certainly all right come on, Honan you always get picked up now, pretty much and it's always somebody, different it's never the same person, from one day to the next it's amazing, there's a lot of good people in this, world all over the place you know right, and on that note here's one more good, personing pretty good Chris Pucket is a, car dealer he wanted to give Bill a, vehicle I wasn't aware that you couldn't, drive but since Bill can't drive I'm, legally blind I got you he handed the, key to christe instead like for real, putting the car in karma I don't even, know what to say Bill go get in that, front seat go over there doing unto, others it's how they roll here in Mr, Bill's Village thank, you bye, babe thank you Steve coming up in a, moment the payoff for a group of men, that charge no fee at all to clean, swimming, [Music], pools there's a group of guys in, California that offer to clean people's, pools for no money at all zip zil zero, because they get paid in another way, it's a unique one here's Carter, Evans an empty swimming pool in Southern, California is about as close as it gets, to a personal skate park but before, these guys, grind they clean the grind so you, actually come in and do the work yes at, your age yeah a lot of times we'll do it, for free too Steve Alba is known as The, Godfather of pool, skating now six 61 years old he'll still, clean your pool for free if you let him, bring his board and his, buddies fellow senior skater Azie osband, scans satellite images for squalled, swimming pools then does a door knock, they often times don't quite understand, you want to do what in the pool and to, be honest with you it started as kind of, a joke to be honest with you to see if, it would actually work and it did and it, did work decades later they've perfected, their pitch which includes signing a, liability, waiver and many homeowners are thrilled, to get rid of the eyesore what was your, pool like a third filled with a bunch of, green slop cuz it was a duck pond but, the skaters saw something different what, makes a good pool yeah the shape of the, pool is that one criteria the the, surface of the pool the plaster the best, pools the skateboard in or the pools, that were made from 1950 to say, 1977 that 27e window is just Prime for, us what's up here this is a filter box, filter box which we call the death box, because if you actually go into it on, the way down you die so you don't want, to fall on that so that's why it's call, the death box the death box is daunting, just try to stay low and keep your knees, bent and keep on your toes but let's be, real I was never going to come close, this is harder than it looks it's way, harder every pool is different every, wall is different it's like this little, puzzle that I have to figure out it's, like this Zen thing where I'm doing, anything I'm thinking about, skateboarding but when I'm skateboarding, I can't think of anything else it's a, very seductive place to be what we do, here is one of the best things in my, opinion you can do in skateboarding and, if you got any more empty pools versus, skate please send them my way for them, an empty pool is full of, possibilities all right we're going to, turn now to a woman who says that most, people do not believe her when she tells, them what she does she is committed to, prove them that she is up to the task, here's CBS Bay areas Sean, [Music], chitus I had my vest on and I went into, Costco and some guy walks over and goes, oh you must be a crosswalk guard and I, said no I build homes Adria vattica, started in that line of work at a young, age her father was was an electrician, and brought her along on jobs when she, was growing up today she represents the, 11% of women who work in construction, this division of the Bay Area I am the, only woman superintendent here so that's, pretty cool she's been in that role for, about 10 years and had to prove to, plenty of men that she's up for the job, transitioning from the customer service, side of construction she loves to, oversee one house after the other, getting ready for someone to move in, Adria wants people to imagine more women, doing work like this not limited to the, sales and marketing jobs in the business, it is so rewarding for my kids to drive, through a community and say you know Mom, built those homes that's cool as a, superintendent her day is filled with, inspections making sure they are meeting, all City requirements at each stage of, the building process Adria says she had, to work harder and be better to earn her, spot in the industry being detail, oriented and a multitasker which she, hopes helps more women to join her in, construction this is not something that, you have to be a male to do she says a, lot of women already have the mindset, and the skills to do the work but don't, realize they could be a part of this, industry where there is a common goal so, many would enjoy achieving together and, the end result is You're Building a, Dream yeah I'm into it that's a great, piece all right coming up in a moment, another great piece a man whose job is, and I mean this literally to spread Joy, where does he work what has got a, microphone I'll give you another hint, it's for a big name that you can watch, here on CBS guesses guesses stick around, you'll find, out it takes a lot of work to be a, service dog they need a lot of training, before they begin their careers as, helpers and there's an organization in, Pennsylvania that is pairing those, trainees with people who can benefit, from the help that's a good thing here's, CBS Pittsburgh's Kim, Gables Richard Hawkins is among the, ranks of Western PA's honor able, community of veterans he served in, Vietnam and his trusted new friend try, well he's among the animals here at the, new location of vet pets of southwestern, Pennsylvania he's here to serve Richard, It's the Final Phase of training for his, certification as a service dog we got, try from New Hope assistance dogs they, train their dogs in uh correctional, facilities and then they give their dogs, to Someone Like Richard Omar Brook Serv, in Iraq finding purpose and Mission in, Saving and training dogs when he, returned from Battle it's a commitment, 18 to 24 months before they're ready to, fully report to duty ours is a longer, process it's a more bonding process so, we say follow us on this journey it's, not going to be easy but weekly you're, going to see a bonding like no other dog, team and the therapeutic benefits are, invaluable to vets and First Responders, combating invisible traumas like PT EST, depression and anxiety it's often, difficult for vets Like Richard to talk, about the, scars good boy but the Gratitude well he, expresses that with enthusiasm the help, that these two people have given not, just to me but probably to the community, at least to to the uh veteran Community, has been, outstanding I don't have any way to put, it in words there's also emotional, support with therapy counseling and, social activities turning these brave, Soldiers into Wellness Warriors seeing, the bond that all the veterans have with, each other is we're a family um so every, part of vet pets has really impacted my, life in the most positive way my goal is, just my goal right now is just keep, helping these people out cuz they've, helped me so much it's been unreal and, there are up and com among the troops, like little anchor here this adorable, pop will soon have a battle buddy of his, own and a bond like Richard and try it's, just a matter of getting knee train yeah, yeah

well uh it was a very a brief statement, she initially she opened the speech was, saying that she didn't know whether she, needs to stay here or fly immediately to, see her children but then she decided to, stay and give the speech because she, thought that her husband uh would have, done that and would have wanted her to, do that as well uh what can you tell us, about the conditions Nal faced in, prison so he was sent into uh Russia's, basically Arctic region it's very far, north it's very cold it's very remote, it's one of those um sort of high, security prisons um in Russia kind of uh, almost reminiscent of the old gag system, um you can't really call them there's, very it's very hard to reach by mail um, the lawyers are still trying to um get, to this prison and cigarette what's what, actually happened there um very harsh, conditions it's very cold um the Wy as, we know was sent to solry Consignment, multiple times and that's very very, harsh conditions you sit alone in a you, know a small cold box um and his teams, always said that they are very concerned, about his health um with regards to how, he was treated in that prison Mary, thanks so much Alexi Nal he bravely, stood up uh to the corruption the, violence and the the all the all the bad, things that the Putin government was, doing in response Putin had him poisoned, he had him arrested he had him, prosecuted for fabricated crimes he sent, into prison he was held in isolation, even all that didn't stop him from, calling out Putin's lies even in prison, he was a powerful voice for the truth, which is kind of amazing when you think, about it and he could have lived safely, in Exile after the assassination attempt, on him in 2020 which nearly killed him I, might add and but he uh he was traveling, outside the country at the time instead, he returned to, Russia returned to Russia knowing he'd, likely be imprisoned or even killed if, he continued his work but he did did it, anyway because he believed so deeply in, his country in Russia reports of his, death if they're true and I have no, reason to believe it or not Russian, authorities are going to tell their own, story but make no mistake make no, mistake Putin is responsible for naval's, death Putin is responsible what has, happened to Nal is yet more proof of, Putin's brutality no one should be, fooled not in Russia not at home not, anywhere in the world Putin does not, only target his citizens of other, countries as we've seen what's going on, in Ukraine right now he also inflicts, terrible crimes on his own people and, his people across Russia and around the, world are mourning the Vol today because, he was so many things that Putin was not, he was Brave he was principled he was, dedicated to building a Russia where the, rule of law existed and the where it, applied to everybody naal believed in, that Russia that Russia he knew it was, the Cause worth fighting for and, obviously even dying for this tragedy, reminds us of the stakes of this moment, we had to provide the funding so Ukraine, can keep defending itself against, Putin's vicious onslaughts and war, crimes you know there was bipartisan, Senate vote that passed overwhelmingly, in the United States Senate to fund, Ukraine now as I've said before and I, mean this on the literal sense history, is watching history is watching the, House of Representatives the failure to, support Ukraine at this critical moment, will never be forgotten it's going to go, down on the pages of History it really, is it's consequential and the clock is, ticking and this has to happen we have, to help now you know we have to realize, what we're dealing with with Putin all, of us should reject the dangerous, statements made by the previous, president that invited Russia to invade, our NATO allies if they weren't paying, up he said if an ally did not pay their, dues he'd encourage Russia to quote do, whatever the hell they, want I guess I should clear my mind here, a little bit not say what I'm really, thinking but let me be, clear this is an outrageous thing for, president to say I can't, fathom can't fathom from Truman on, they're rolling over in their graves, hearing this as long as I'm president, America stands by our sacred commitment, to our NATO allies as they have stood by, their commitments to us repeatedly Putin, and the whole world should know if any, adversary to attack us our NATO allies, would back us and if Putin were to, attack a NATO Ally the United States, will defend every inch of NATO, territory now is the time for even, greater Unity among our NATO allies to, stand up to the threat that Putin's, Russia poses you know I send my deepest, condolences Alexi staff and supporters, are going to continue his work despite, this loss despite all of Putin's, desperate attempts to Stamp Out the, opposition and most of all to his family, especially to his wife his daughter and, his son who have already sacrificed so, much for their family and a shared dream, for a better future for Russia so I just, want to say God bless Alexi Naval his, courage will not be forgotten and I'm, sure it will not be the only courage we, see coming out of Russia in the near, term thank you I'll be happy to take a, couple questions sir first was this an, assassination the answer is that we, don't know exactly what happened but, there is no doubt that the death of, theal was the consequence of something, that Putin and his and his thugs did and, to be clear you warned Vladimir Putin, when he in Geneva of devastating, consequences if navali died in Russian, custody what consequences should he and, Russia face that was three years ago in, the meantime they faced a hell of a lot, of consequences they've lost and or had, wounded over, 350,000 Russian soldiers they've made in, a position where they've been subjected, to Great sanctions across the board and, we're contemplating what else could be, done but the what we were talking about, at the time there were no actions being, taken against Russia and that look all, has transpired since, then you're looking at increasing, sanctions on Russia right now we're, looking at a whole number of options, that's all I'll say right now is there, anything you can do to get ammunition to, the ukrainians without the supplemental, from Congress no but it's about time, they step up don't you think instead of, going on a two we, vacation two weeks they're walking away, two, weeks what are they think, thinking my God this is bizarre and it's, just reinforcing all the concern and and, and almost I won't say panic but real, concern about the United States being a, reliable Ally this is outrageous are you, more confident now that you'll get the, Ukraine Aid given what's happened today, well I hope to God it helps but I mean, the idea we need anything more to get, the Ukraine Aid I mean I mean this is in, light of a former president's statement, that saying Russia if if they haven't, pay the dues to us go get them come on, what are these guys doing what are they, doing sir how concerned are you about, the anti-satellite capability that, Russia is developing and what is your, Administration planning to do in, response first of all there is no, nuclear threat to the people of America, or anywhere else in the world with what, Russia is doing at the moment number one, number two anything that they're doing, and or they will do relates to, satellites in space and damaging those, satellites potentially number three I, there is no evidence that they have made, a decision to go forward with doing, anything in space either so what we, found out there was a capacity to launch, a system in the space that could, theoretically do something that was, damaging hadn't happened yet and uh my, expect my hope is it will not thank, you take thank you Mr President uh, Switching gears for a moment have the, Israelis presented a credible evacuation, plan for the nearly 1.5 million, displaced Palestinians Sheltering in, Rafa and what would the consequences be, for Israel if they move ahead with a, fullscale ground invas without clear, measures to protect civilians there well, first of all I've had extensive, conversations with the prime minister of, Israel over the last several days almost, an hour, each and uh I've made the case and I, feel very strongly about it that there, has to be a uh a temporary, ceasefire to get the prisoners out to, get the hostages out and that is, underway I'm still hopeful that that can, be done and in the, meantime uh I don't anticipate I hope, that uh you that the Israelis will not, make any massive land invasion in the, meantime um so it's my expectation, that's not going to happen there has to, be a ceasefire temporarily to get those, hot by the way there are we're in a, situation where there are American, hostages American citizens are being, held hostage it's not just not just, Israelis it's American hostages as well, and uh you know uh My Hope and, expectation is that we'll get this, hostage deal we'll bring the Americans, home and the deal is being negotiated, now and uh we're going to see where it, takes, [Music], us FBI an FBI informant an FBI informant, at the center of the impeachment inquiry, into you has been indicted for allegedly, lying your reaction to that and should, the inquiry be dropped he is lying and, should be dropped and it's just been, a it's been an outrageous effort from, the, [Music], beginning we head back to our top story, today Russia officials say the country's, most prominent Putin critic Alexi novali, has died in prison a spokesperson for, Nal says they are still trying to, confirm his death the 47-year-old was, serving a sentence for extremism in one, of Russia's harshest penal colonies a, kremin spokesperson says that President, Putin is up to date on nal's death and, Russia's investigative committee has, launched a probe Russia meanwhile is, gearing up for a presidential election, in which Putin is all but certain to win, President Biden spoke about the news, from the White House just moments, ago people across Russia and around the, world are mourning ofy today because he, was so many things that Putin was was, not he was Brave he was principled he, was dedicated to building a Russia where, the rule of law existed and of where it, applied to, everybody CBS News White House reporter, Willie James Inman is with us now Willie, we heard uh President Biden say that his, administration is actually looking at, other possible qu consequences for, Russia in response to nal's death what, are you learning hey there Lana that's, right those consequences could involve, San ition that's what the president was, asked earlier today in terms of how the, US will respond to this death of Alexi, Nali and the President also mentioned, well it's not been confirmed exactly by, the US government that he said he, believes that it to be true he said that, he is not surprised but he also, mentioned that he is outraged by this, death we saw the vice president earlier, today she also expressed her, condemnation of this event happening to, Alexi FY of course an opposition leader, there in Russia who has been in prison, for quite some time there was actually a, moment where the vice president met with, naval's wife who was on the sidelines at, the Munich security conference she spoke, right after the Vice President spoke and, gave remarks earlier today and vice, president Harris according to the PO, report met briefly Whit nal's wife and, essentially expressed her sympathies for, his family in this terrible tragedy but, one of the things I wanted to point out, in the president's statement uh he, essentially condemned Russia but said, this is yet again evidence of Russia's, brutality and the brutality of Russian, leader Vladimir Putin yeah he also, reminded the nation that in 2020 Naval, was the uh the subject of an, assassination attempt and nonetheless he, went back to Russia to continue to fight, for the future of his homeland in a way, that is contrary to the Putin, Administration um I I want to talk a, little bit about what we heard from the, president in terms of standing by NATO, allies he called again for additional, funding for Ukraine he called on, Congress to to do their job um but he, also made a contrast between himself and, the former president likely the person, that he is going to run against uh in, this upcoming presidential election, about NATO and standing with our NATO, allies talk to our viewers about why, that's so, significant yeah well this comes after, comments by the former president, essentially saying that Russia would be, able to do whatever they wanted if NATO, allies didn't pay up in terms of paying, a percentage of their GDP uh in military, spending uh in nato in military spending, and the former president has been, blasted by not only President Biden but, other others within the Democratic, atmosphere President Biden has used this, as a campaign rallying Cry he's also, been very critical of former president, Trump essentially calling those comments, dumb uh the president uh strongly has, said that uh in this in these remarks, that he gave earlier today that this is, not the pathway that we're we want to go, down that we want to make sure that we, defend NATO allies he also called on the, United States to further support Ukraine, in its time of need with that Ukraine, funding making its way through the, Senate uh but also being stalled in the, house and the president essentially, saying that history will not judge this, kindly in terms of uh the United States, not coming to the support of Ukraine in, its time of need and I think it's, interesting to see this President uh, speak so forcefully he actually paused, there lot I'm pretty sure you saw it too, yeah like he almost wanted to say, something else uh we know this President, often times shows emotion uh when it, comes to personal moments his his family, but he also is starting to show show a, lot more emotion when it comes to his, potential and likely opponent former, president Donald Trump trump yeah a long, pause there as he said former presidents, were turning over in their graves Willie, James Inman at the White House thank you, you, bet","shortTranscript":"reports of his death if they're true and, I have no reason to believe it they're, not Russian authorities are going to, tell their own story but make no mistake, make no

set to Boom thanks to, unprecedented levels of migration how is, the country supposed to cope and was, there really no choice other than, Allison Hammond to take over from the, late great Paulo Grady on for the love, of, [Music], dogs hello and welcome to the reaction, with me Sarah Vine and me Andrew Pierce, we're going to be here every Wednesday, on The Daily mails YouTube channel so, make sure you like And subscribe so you, never miss an episode and thank you all, for your comments and emails about last, week's show here's the reaction to the, reaction, well last week we asked whether it was, insensitive for Harry and mean to be, pictured hobnobbing with the prime, minister of Jamaica a republican when, King Charles was about to undergo, surgery many of you wrote calling for, the couple to be stripped of their Royal, titles including Sandra who emailed to, say I'm very much in favor of Harry and, Megan losing their titles they aren't, fit to call themselves Royal they're in, embarrassment I feel sorry for the, king however Janette from YouTube uh had, this to say they are entitled to do and, go wherever they choose why all the, negative comments from people that don't, even know them they have the right to, pick and choose whatever they want to, participate in I actually sorry I no you, can't have your cake and eat it anyway, but they do but they do and eat a lot of, cake and reaction to our discussion, around the woke agenda and politics, Helen on YouTube says Sarah Vine is spot, on all this POS polarized politics is, doing nothing for the majority of people, in the country whatever their political, persuasion I've been a labor voter in, most general elections but I doubt that, I will be in future there's no well vote, conservative either following the mess, they created under Boris and on the, discussion around the reintroduction of, national service Justin on YouTube says, it's easy for Sarah to say bring back, national service being someone who would, be protected from the draft only because, I'm so incredibly old but my children, wouldn't be protected from the draft, would I want you to be drafted cuz I, want you to be sergeant major Sarah so, thank you for all your emails all your, comments we want you to keep them coming, we read them all and we'll be and they, we will be featuring the very best every, week so now let's kick off with this, week's Royal, reaction so in emails that the BBC has, finally released despite spending, 200,000 of our money trying not to, Martin Basher blames racism for the row, around his interview with Princess Diana, Andrew do you think this might be right, or is that just another of his excuses, it's pitiful and it's pathetic and it's, stupid and it's nothing to do with it, it's nothing to do with his color we've, got Clyde M presenting the 10:00 news, every, day is very proud of his black origin, it's it's stupid he Martin Basher is, guilty of some of the worst lies told by, a journalist to try to secure a scoop, that we've ever come cross including, confecting a story that Tiggy leg Burke, who was the nanny to Harry and William, had an abortion paid for by Prince, Charles uh there were confected bank, statements uh suggesting that um uh that, Patrick jeffson who was dying as private, secretary was leaking stories about, deess feeding into the princess's, paranoia and her vulnerable mental state, he is a disgrace to the BBC and he's a, disgrace to our profession so I think, it's just you know but also anyone who, knows anything about the BBC knows that, it's scrupulous about things like racism, and they're just so careful about it the, emails that have been published in the, last 24 hours uh 10,000 documents have, come to light because of the, extraordinary uh campaigning by the uh, uh the investigative journalist Andy, Webb Andy's been on this for more than I, think more than 15 years and joins us, now Andy um congratulations this is uh, just for sheer perseverance and I know, taking on the BBC which tries to crush, or assistance is quite something but why, is it important to people watching this, uh listening to this Andy because have, you potentially identif we know there, was a cover up in 96 about how Basher, got the story have they been covering up, again covering up over the cover up well, I I suspect my suspicion and I'm a, journalist like you guys so that you, know I make that absolutely clear it is, my suspicion but yes I think they have, and why this particularly matters is it, is not a rehash of something that TW, that happened 29 years ago it's not to, try and put further detail on exactly, what the forg bank statements looked, like or who gave them or or or what what, have you this is to do with a strategy, which I fully believe was uh dreamt up, and enacted in 2020 in order to keep the, entire Scandal the whole Scandal uh, still under as it had been for 25 years, so this was something that was um put, put into play a little over three years, ago importantly by the people it who are, still running the BBC today it's those, people who have seen fit to spend I uh I, say and I think there's evidence to say, this around a quarter of a million, pounds quarter of a million pounds on, preventing this material becoming public, and For Heaven's Sake I mean this is not, just the fact that it is in effect, public money license fee money that's, being spent it's being spent by um if, you like I've often seen it describe, itself as the largest news Gathering, organization in the world the very last, institution that should be with whatever, kind of money whoever's money it is, trying to actually stifle um the the, dissemination and publication of very, very um you know important information, the BBC has said in the last 24 hours, these documents are irrelevant they, don't matter if that's the case why did, they spend so much public money trying, to suppress and block their release, because clearly there's something in, them they don't want us to see would be, my my, estimation well that would be my, estimation too and I would say again, what justification what possible, justification do I have for my suspicion, well um here are a few I mean this is, it's now when this when this material, finally um emerged yesterday that was, 970 days 970 days since my foi request, had gone in the law says they should be, dealt with uh in 20 days now why is it, taking so long because well all sorts of, reasons we're currently uh partway, through a tribunal process where there, is a judge and two lay assessors and the, judge has said loud and clear that he, and his colleagues have serious concern, serious concern about the way the BBC is, handled itself during this whole process, in in his judgment it is even fair to, say that he um, allows suspicion of the BBC's good faith, in this as I say you know judges just, phrase things very carefully and I want, to stress that but that that is the, clear implication of what he said so, those two things being the case would it, be uh Fair would it be sensible would it, actually be judicious as it were to be, suspicious well I think it would I think, it would and and that's why when one is, presented with 10,000 pages of documents, which you reducted top to bottom and, side to side we simply must see what is, behind that reduction do and do you, think there will be names that would, that are still there at the BBC who, could get themselves into trouble and do, you think there will be instructions to, bashier that might you know suggest that, it wasn't just him acting on his, own the second question I would say no I, don't think I don't suspect that that is, that is what we're looking at I don't, think it's a reference back to uh what, actually happened back in 95 1996, as as to the first question I think, absolutely yes it is people very very, much who are still in power at the BBC, who I fully believe, um we're involved in this yes absolutely, and that is why it's so important we've, seen Andy in the last few weeks and, months this extraordinary collapsing, trust around the post office which used, to be seen as a rather vulnerable, institution the BB the reason this BB, the reason the basharan 2 went so big, worldwide was because it was from the, fabled BBC The Trusted BBC if there is, now evidence that you've got you're, uncovering of a further cover up how, damaging will that be to the reputation, Integrity of the BBC and how much more, damage can that institution sustain I, think it I think it would inevitably, prove um extremely damaging and I I, think it's actually worth bearing in, mind something like this that we in in, this country we um haven't and, to a large degree rightly have very very, fonded uh Notions of the BBC you know, the um the shipping forecast and all the, rest of it around the world I don't, think it's quite the same I think in a, lot of place and I travel a lot for my, job around the world, currently um you know if you ask, somebody in Manila or Minnesota the BBC, is he yeah isn't that the outfit who um, took down Princess Diana I think I heard, of that I think I heard of that BBC and, why is that it's because they watch the, crown now you know the crown essentially, setting the historical um template for, us and indeed it will remain for years, if not decades so that to that degree, already I think the BBC has taken a, major hit um whether the story that I've, been pursuing if it comes to the, fruition that it might whether that sort, of spreads much beyond the British, borders who knows but no it it's it's, just not great and and just let me very, very quickly say that the position we're, now in with the judge issuing his, criticism and these very legitimate, questions being raised about why do you, spend a quarter of a million pounds to, keep irrelevant stuff um you know Under, Wraps this is without in effect, looking underneath a single one of these, emails the the 10,000 documents are, still pretty much tightly wrapped in, their red so all of this awful publicity, the this awful situation the BBC has got, itself into is without even, seeing what really might be at stake, here well thank you Andy I mean I do I, think you're right I think I think, what's going to happen is that is that, the British public will become less and, less trusting of the of the BBC and and, it's done it to itself thank you so much, Andy Webb thank you and well done done, yes you done what a tenacious man you, are journalism had its best yes thank, you now the B have responded of course, they say this in their statement, throughout this process we have taken, our responsibilities to comply with the, directions of the tribunal extremely, seriously therefore we've today released, approximately 3,000 documents some, 10,000 pages to Mr web we've made, redactions where necessary consistent, with Freedom of Information Act there is, nothing to support the allegations the, BBC acted in bad faith in 2020 we, maintain the suggestion is simply wrong, of course sah if there weren so many, redactions there wouldn't be suspicion, that they have, anyway let us know your reaction to, Martin bash's claims and the BBC's, reluctance uh reluctance to release, information about the affair at reaction, at dailymail.co.uk or comment below and, don't forget to tune in for more Royal, debate on Thursday's episode of our, smash hit royal Show Palace confidential, on The Daily mail's royal YouTube, channel so the labor leader secure starm, has promised to ban all forms of con, conversion therapy with an emphasis on, trans therapy if he's elected he says, it's psychologically damaging abuse, Sarah I'm worried about this because I, got a horrible feeling where this is, going to go uh I've talked a lot to, people in the LGBT whatever it is now Q, Community LGBT because I'm in part of, the community and I was a early member, of Stonewall campaigning for equality My, worry is a Catal conversion therapy, sounds great because we don't want, people who are trans to be bullied into, being told that no actually you don't, need to change your gender you don't, need to be in a different body My worry, is that if a teacher has a conversation, like this with a child or whether this, comes into the home whether a parent has, that conversation they're going to be, penalized because it could happen and it, might happen and that's very worrying, well this is what's happening already in, Scotland so it's quite interesting, because it shows how K dama is sort of, looking towards the uh Scottish national, party to sort of do little deals, together we can already see that um my, taste of things to come yes Taste of, things to come My worry is that of, course nobody wants uh trans people to, feel that they can't you know become, what they want to become but when you're, dealing with children especially, underage children you have to be very, careful because they're very easily, swayed by Trends and peer pressure and, things like that so you need to have, safeguards in place to make sure that, what they're asking for is what they, actually genuinely want and we've seen, cases like Kira Bell who took her case, to the car High Court who um, transitioned from being a girl to, becoming a boy had irreversible hormone, treatment and I'm not sure if she had, surgery but anyway she had irreversible, hormone therapy and is now you know has, infertile has facial hair has body and, regrets it and cannot undo that and she, said famously that you know she felt, that she had mental health issues that, she was depressed and that perhaps if, she'd been treated for depression or if, she'd had some sort of alternative, therapy to people simply saying okay, here we go let's turn you into a man she, wouldn't have gone down this route now I, think under these proposals that would, probably fall under the remit of, conversion therapy so she wouldn't have, been able to access that alternative the, reason I'm worried about it Sarah is I, don't trust sakir starma on this issue, at all because we know he famous he said, uh uh asked if a woman can have if a man, can have a cervix that's not a, straightforward question yes it is, straightforward question with a, straightforward answer a man cannot have, a cervix and he's a he's also said that, one in every thousand women has a penis, I don't trust him I think he will be too, easily led by shall we say the extremist, in the trans lobby as opposed to, sensible people like JK ring who we've, discussed here before who is heroic in, my view because she stands up for women, only SP people like Debbie ha who talk, very movingly in the paper this week, brilliant piece in the paper this week, about how she is a woman but she was a, man and she you know the difficulties, it's complicated and she was really I, you know she's still married to the, person that she married when she was a, man and all the sort of so I think there, is a lot of uh there's a lot of, important questions here it's an, important issue but I think you're right, if it gets hijacked by the sort of you, know extreme wing of the trans Lobby, then it won't have a good outcome and, and we've seen with um the Canterbury MP, Rosie dufford labor the abuse she's got, from her own side from women in her own, party political party women MPS because, she's de to take the The View that you, and I may hold on the trans issue which, is why again I'm very worried about k d, and this that he's going to be captured, and then uh teachers doing their job, saying actually you may be a bit too, young to think about this let's have a, proper grownup conversation about, parents need to know as well because, parents are parents have to be part of, it as well it's not you know there's a, lot of if you if you look on Tik Tok and, places like that there's an awful lot of, Nar a big narrative in this thing that, you know you have to reject your parents, you have to reject your family but if, you're going to make a big decision like, this then surely you want your family to, be on side and you want them to support, you and they want you want them to help, them but the the other thing is is that, again with kiss Dharma and this is a, broader political point is that he, always goes for the path of least, resistance he's too scared to make the, complicated difficult arguments and if, you're going to be prime minister and, you're going to be on an international, scale and you're going to be making, really important you have to be able to, make those difficult arguments you have, to be able to push back and this is all, happening in the week question you know, what I mean completely which is why I, don't trust him and it's all this is all, happened course in the week we've, discovered a four-year-old going to, school without the other teachers and, kids in the school knowing and they that, it was a little boy going to school as a, girl yeah this is not where we should be, going with children they are children, let them grow up as children let them be, boys and let them be girls and what, starma has to clarify is what age is he, talking about this conversion therapy, cuz I actually don't think it should, begin till at the very very least you're, 18 the very least well the problem is is, the people who who support it say that, if you wait until you're 18 or 21 and, then you've gone through puberty in, whatever biological sex you were born in, and therefore it's much harder to, reverse to to make the changes that you, want to make and I do understand that, point but the point is that that you you, know you can't you you can't delay, puberty indefinitely in people well they, can cuz they pump some of these kids, full of drugs but also you have to wait, for their brain to catch up with their, with the with the rest of their body, it's a really difficult area and I just, think these sort of blanket, pronouncements are just well they just, they don't do anyone any favors they, don't do trans people any favors and, they don't help the situation they just, they just all they're designed to do is, to make K sta look like he's super woke, and and ironically back in the S&P when, we know that Nicholas stt's whole, reputation started collapsing soon after, her position on the I mean aligning, yourself with the S&P in that way on, these issues on these culture issues is, quite interesting is let's look at the, S&P I mean you know we've got Nicholas, ston uh the covid inquiry uh telling, everyone that she deleted all her whats, confirming it confirming it um there's a, whole big cloud over them about funding, of the party about whether there was, appropriation of funds there's there's, all sorts of other little clouds I mean, I just think funny time to Embrace M, urgen whose Halo has firmly slipped so, what do you think about this let us know, your thoughts at reaction, dailymail.uk or you comment, below according to new figures migrants, will account for, 92% of the UK's population boom in the, coming years as it's set to grow by 6.6, million to 73.7 Million by 201 36 Andrew, this is a huge issue isn't it well look, this country listening no this country, is bursting at the scams in my view i', take a more Hardline view than you on, this we are bursting at the seams we, cannot last year uh legal migration um, was uh what was it uh nearly, 800,000 which is a major town this is, predicting uh 6 A5 million in 11 years, that that is six times Birmingham so, where are the homes coming from where, are the hospital coming from the school, places and how many of these people, Sarah will speak English how many of, them will make any effort whatsoever to, integrate into our culture uh in my view, not enough because we we see from these, projected figures that a lot of them, will come from uh countries which don't, speak English as a first tongue and I, just think it's going to cause huge, problems with social cohesion we've seen, towns and cities like Bradford Ros and, rdale change beyond belief and only this, week Sarah and Manchester labor MP, introducing a candidate a labor, candidate in Rochdale delivered half his, speech in erdu I'm sorry to camera that, means because I think the population in, in Rochdale the ethnic population is, about 35 40% 60% minimum will not have, understood a word of that speech yeah, that's the white majority that is very, very wor that's where we're going the I, suppose the question is why are people, coming here why soft touch well but also, because we need them here because we, won't do the jobs that they will do we, don't need 6 and a half million well, okay but fine a a lot of these people, coming are nurses they're carers they're, they're cleaners they're doing the, menial tasks that British people don't, want to do so I mean what are we, supposed to do I mean you can't not have, any nurses in any I mean I understand, what you're saying we don't need 6 and a, half million nurses I but the point is, that where are all the Brits doing the, jobs that they're coming from because, now we've got this new rule that you, have to to earn 38,000 so but you know, there are now barriers to entry good uh, but so they if they're still projected, to come there's a problem with us, basically importing people to do the, jobs that the Brits don't want to do is, I mean isn't that something we should, talk about and confront but the figure, the figure of 6.6 million that's be, they'll just be the legal one Sarah, they'll just be the legal and are we, still going to have a c a filler of, small boats U floating across the CH, boats is, tiny numbers compared to this I that's, 30,000 year but and these are not people, who are coming from Europe these are, people who are coming from outside of, Europe so so what we're doing is we're, importing all our all our Labor uh which, is ridiculous because we've already got, enough people in this country to do what, are our EMP unemployment figures going, to do you know it's it's you've got to, understand that there's a reason why, these people are coming because there's, jobs for them and and they demand for, them and they know they'll get benefits, and they know they get Council housing, so so you know there needs to be a sort, of there needs to be a complicated and, wellth thought out remedy to this and it, has to involve the Brits actually doing, something more than just sitting, watching their wi their wi we've talked, about this before that the benefit, system shouldn't make it more attractive, for people to work at home I there's a, member part of my family who works only, part-time uh in her hotel because it's, more advantageous financially to work, part-time and claim benefits how, ridiculous is that uh and she's thinking, about her children so she's obviously, going to go the route which maximizes, income but part of the reason we voted, for brexit and it's the fourth, anniversary today of that famous moment, when we came out of the European Union, officially at 11:00 p.m. before you skap, today was because we wanted to control, our borders and many people who voted, for brexit I would argue Sarah said, there's too much immigration coming in, from Eastern Europe thank you Tony Blair, because he did it deliberately but I, think six and a half million I think, it's it could cause potential civil, unrest well especially if there's no, integration I mean I think this is the, problem immigration is one thing but if, people don't integrate with the host, culture which you know is is a British, liberal democracy effectively um you, know then that is going to cause huge, issues if you've got a labor MP making a, speech to camera last time I looked it, had been viewed 450,000 times not many, MPS get people viewing their speeches on, uh social media 450,000 times half of it, in a foreign tongue that is a very very, disturbing Trend and it will be, exacerbating if we accept 6 and a half, million people in the next 11 years, where are they all going to go where are, we going to go well I mean this is the, thing is we go together some BL was, arrested wasn't here this week for um, trying to smuggle people out of Britain, maybe that'll be us trying to trying to, get into the EU but we do need to take, responsibility it's you can't just blame, the immigrants Andrew you just can't BL, because they're here because the system, makes it easy for them to come and, because we want their cheap labor and, that's the honest truth and we need to, face up to that that's our fault not, theirs well I'm very worried about it, anyway let us know what you think at the, reaction do you agree with Sarah do you, agree with me of course you agree with, him people ageuk it's not very I'm not, I'm often not pop people say oh you're, horrible nasty right winger so what a, lot of people think yes of course, absolutely let us know what you think at, reaction dailymail.co.uk or comment, below big emotive issue I think very, motive, issue, now Allison Hammond you know her very, irritating she's been announced as the, new presenter of For the Love of dogs, and she's replacing the late great and, much loved Paula Grady who sadly died, last year well for the love of God Sarah, if you pardon the pun was there nobody, else is that why doing this item so that, you could do that it is a great L if you, don't mind that I thought of that myself, I think the thing about Alison Hammond, she's got that thing that CLA balding, had a few years ago which is that she's, for some reason everyone thinks she, needs to present all of the show shows, she she did very well didn't she uh she, had a moment where she sort of stood in, for was it Holly Willoughby yeah yeah am, I right about that she was on this, morning yeah and everyone thought oh, she's quite good and now now she's been, given a million jobs but I do think, someone like Julian Clary would have, been better I don't think she has any, loves dogs J long history when I think, Allison Hammond I don't think massive, dog lover I think fun lady who bounces, around she does bounce around and she's, she's entertaining and I I don't think, I've met her but and she very popular, clearly but you just thought to thought, somebody who's known for the love of, dogs I mean I I I love I mean I often, put dogs on my page I love dogs i' I'd, love to present that sh I was just about, to say I feel an agenda here I think, Sarah move over Earth you come up with, Alison Hammond where Sarah Vine could, have done the job she knows a lot about, dogs you have a dog I have a dog I have, several dogs I have a dog called muffin, she's a Lassa abso she's very sweet, she's very sweet she's a princess do you, think she'll will get used to it and, she'll settle into it and it'll be okay, well I just hope for her sake that she, doesn't sort of Overkill you know there, can there is a moment where everyone, goes oh God not not so and so again well, I rather feel that about that actress, who won the Oscar in um the the about, Queen Anne she just you had you had to, go you had to go at her last week she, she go she's on everything we just sick, to death of her give her somebody else a, chance and that would be my thing about, Hammond she's just on it seemed quite a, lot yeah and when did we last see juli, and Clary on Prime Time television he, was brilliant in the pantomine he yes, you yes oh brilliant he's quite good on, on on uh on the twitters but yes Julian, clar would have been better well he, certainly actually what she really means, is Sarah Bine would have been better no, but Julian Clary is a National Treasure, is it is it he who described himself as, a a stately homo or was that someone, else no it was him it was him yes I love, that line that's a brilliant line he is, a St and he was a great and in the, pantomim which was at the padium which, was packed every night twice a day he, paid tribute to Paul Grady every night, and it was really rather moving actually, so he was the obvious and he would have, ticked the diversity box cuz Allison, Hammond ticks the diversity box she's a, woman she's black she's a large lady, Junior CLA takes the diversity box GES a, goose the other thing problem for Alison, Hamm is she is stepping into a really, rather large enormous shoes I'm not sure, I'd want to actually because uh I don't, think anybody she makes a mistake that, dog love don't you know don't approve of, she'll be in terrible trouble you will, cuz we're tricky people dog lovers and, are you glued to the show were you glued, to the show I really liked it I used to, really enjoy it yeah I'm so sorry he, died talk show he was too young yes have, you ever been to crafts no but I do, watch well let me tell you if you go to, crafts it, stinks dog poo because I'm afraid, they're not very well trained and if you, go around the back where they're in, their cage oh they are well trained it's, just nervous you need to go in, Wellington dogs will poo if they're nerv, um I did one of my dogs did um win, Westminster dog of the year yeah I yeah, that's cuz you got me to vote for it she, got everyone to vote for it she was, shocking these politicians and their, wives you know she we were on a three, line whip vote for my dog so I did, probably about seven times so probably, you won it under a false pretend and it, wasn't this dog either was it it was a, previous it was a fix up obviously vote, T's rig election shock exactly shock, horror there you go anyway, yeah so what do you think of Alison is, she the right person for the job do you, think she's a good choice or should it, have gone to someone else Julian Clary, Sarah Vine definitely Sarah Vine and you, get I will bring and you never have to, buy another T of dog food no just, imagine she doesn't eat dog food in a, tin I make it for her oh she has, homemade dog food that's what a dog, that's more than you ever did for your, husband, exactly she gets chicken and rice with, vegetables and probiotics oh, she better life than me I think I'm, coming round let us know what you think, you can email reaction dailymail.co.uk, or of course please comment below Sarah, Vine dog, lover well this week my allergic, reaction I make no apology for it is the, president of the United States utterly, incoherent firstly speaking at a brewery, in Wisconsin and then a little later, well look why don't you take a look and, see for yourself the beer brewed here it, is used to make the brew beer in, this oh Earth Rider thanks for the great, lake and then and as if that wasn't bad, enough just a few days later he did, sound like he'd had rather a lot of yeah, yeah well so so first youd say had he, been at the beer in that Brewery because, my God he was incoherent but then a, couple of days later an event in South, Carolina where he's talking about the, killing of three American servicemen, this is what he sounded like, and one last, thing I want to point out that we had a, tough day last night in the Middle East, we lost three brave souls and attack one, of our BAS, yeah Sil, all we, this God bless you all thank you for, allowing to be here and uh, and the thing is you could almost it's, not funny you could hear that woman, saying geez AB that's what I was, thinking I it's not funny it's he's the, president of the United States he's the, most powerful figure man in the world, politician in the world and what is, really particularly unfunny is the, Democrats are about to get him to be to, run for a second term another four years, he can't do it he's me he's got mental, issu that he sounded like he was drunk, on the beer I mean had he been in the, Brewer for a bit too long didn't even, know what he was saying he wasn't making, any sense it was as though he didn't, know who he was where he was what day it, was or anything the Republicans are, going to play those tapes again and, again and and responding to the the, biggest loss of American Military Life, for some years and he make it can barely, even reach the microphone Andrew we've, got all the stuff at the moment in the, news about oh everyone must prepare for, war Russia blah blah blah this is this, is what this is what the Americans are, putting up to defend themselves with and, the guy doesn't know what day of the, week it is he's in charge of the, American Military God help us oh exactly, he's got his finger on the nuclear, button that man has got his finger on, the nuclear button that's not okay he, has to go and they have to retire him, and the first lady has to do the right, thing and say Jo Honey yeah you've got, to stand down you know it will come to, us all yeah it'll come to anyway I mean, I I completely agree it's and the thing, is what is extraordinary is it's going, to make Donald Trump look even more, presidential we keep seeing these clips, I mean these are not this is not the, first time he's done something didn't, even make big news in America people, just look at him and go oh there dear, old Joe Dear Old Joe Joe I know but it's, not okay you're absolutely right M you, know what's getting on, M Vapes I just don't understand why, rishy is dying on this hill it makes no, sense to me at all I understand Vapes, horid and I completely he's B well he's, Banning Vapes disposable VAP try he's, going to ban disposable Vapes appar, that's what kids buy it is what kids buy, I know this cuz both because well one of, my kids my other kid doesn't buy Vapes, but one of my kids has always bought, nasty cheap disposable Vapes even when, she wasn't allowed to um because kids, are like that if they're a bit, rebellious but the thing, is there are a lot of kids who use Vapes, instead of smoking cigarettes and, actually because of the way the Vape, Market has been so poorly regulated thus, far so I do think there's a an argument, for doing something about Vapes but I, think this is a slightly shutting the, stable door after the horse's bolted, moment because there's a lot of kids out, there now who are now totally addicted, to nicotine yeah and who if you take, away their Vapes just they not smoking,  yeah which is much worse sort of, mad so the only I think the only people, who are really going to benefit from, this are the tobacco is the tobacco, industry who will go yay you've got, thanks for getting all these kids, addicted now we can give them cigarettes, I I mean I know the primes is looking, around for a narrative to Define who, government but do we really want to see, the British prime minister talking about, and we're going to ban vot disposable, votes aren't there bigger issues for him, to be engag I really do think so I mean, I know one the health secretary it is, one of also I know that richy has this, clean living thing you know he does all, the fasting and he's 36 hours could you, fast for 36 hours um I don't think so no, have you ever done it no ridiculous idea, no I don't not certainly not once a week, I know and and and of course he wants to, stop children smoking all very audable, yes but this is but what you need to do, to stop children smoking is you need to, enforce a the ban on buying Vapes and, cigarettes under the age of 16 which, currently doesn't happen you go to any, any most news agents will sell a 14y old, shop near me it is like an oldfashioned, Sweet Shop it is a blaze of Color Blaze, of colors all these different flavors, bubble gum and raspber who are they, aimed at not people our age you know, what you need to do is to give the, police the resource is to make sure that, they can stop these kids from buying the, things that they shouldn't be buying you, know Banning things doesn't the thing, about banning things especially with, kids and the thing is it is kids who are, smoking exactly they they think oh it's, even cooler now than it was before yeah, that's my thought anyway that's it for, today uh join us again next week if you, can for more reaction to the stories, making the headlines and make sure you, like And subscribe so that you never, miss an episode how could you miss s see, you again I'll bring the dog in next, week do see you again next Wednesday, goodbye, [Music],

democracy Now democracynow.org, The War and Peace report I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonzalez we look now at how, President Biden appears to be caving to, Republican demands for Hardline border, measures in exchange for funding for the, war in Ukraine that also include a new, Crackdown on Asylum Seekers and, immigrants Nationwide this is CBS, reporter Montoya, gz these changes include a new Authority, that would allow border agents to, summarily expel migrants back to Mexico, or their home countries no questions, asked without an asylum screening very, similar to the title 42 pandemic policy, that ended in may they have also, proposed mandatory detention for the, migrants who would be allowed to make a, case for Asylum and finally they would, be open to a Nationwide expansion of, something called expediter removal which, is a fast-tracked deportation process, that is currently limited to the Border, region as negotiations on Biden's, emergency funding requests continue, we're joined from the Canon rotunda on, Capital Hill by Democratic Congress, member Greg casar of Texas our co-host, Juan Gonzalez just joined Congressman, casar for a congressional briefing, Tuesday on us Latin America policy um, welcome back to democracy Now it's great, to have you with us um Congress member, casar if you can first respond uh to, what's being negotiated at this point, Progressive Democrats saying to, President Biden you not only have to, negotiate with the Republicans you have, to negotiate with us which includes you, uh Congress member, casar good morning Amy thanks so much, for having me on and it is a really, scary time here on Capitol Hill where, Republicans in the Senate are asking, Democrats to cave in and hand them some, of the worst changes to our immigration, system in decades Republicans and, Democrats alike have both said that they, support continued assistance to Ukraine, but the Republicans have held that, hostage and have said first you've got, to throw immigrant families under the, bus and like you've described this would, mean actually closing legal Pathways for, migration here and accelerating the, deportation and separation of immigrant, families and so in the mainstream media, this is often being reported as well are, they going to trade border security for, Ukraine money this has nothing to do, with changing or improving a situation, at the border what the Republicans are, demanding is making it less easy to, legally migrate and therefore fuel more, irregular migration what they're talking, about is punishing families that are, already in our cities and communities, dismantling the Asylum system that we, established after the enormous um errors, we made after World War II turning, refugees away it is sick and so what, we're asking is for the Biden, Administration to stop encouraging these, talks asking leader Schumer to just step, in and say if we want to debate Ukraine, we should debate Ukraine but we, shouldn't start throwing immigrant, families under the bus next thing they, may ask for an abortion ban Nationwide, in exchange for something are they going, to be asking for a ban on gay marriage, next time we just can't have Democrats, doing the Republicans dirty work, here and Congressman as we discussed at, the briefing yesterday the the United, States has spent over, $330 billion the past uh the past 20, years on agencies that do border, enforcement and yet we have record, numbers of people attempting to cross, the border uh what can be done to uh to, get Congress to finally address the, issue of a much more comprehensive, reform of our immigration, system we have to actually want to, improve the system for folks in the, United States and for people migrating, here unfortunately the right-wing wants, to keep the system as broken as possible, so that they can then complain about it, it's the classic case of the arsonists, trying to blame the firefighters for the, flames and so in this case Republican, policy and frankly even some, conservative and uh neoliberal, Democratic policy has only fueled, greater challenges th those policies are, things like sanctions imposing harsh, sanctions in Cuba Nicaragua and, Venezuela then forcing people who are, starving in part because of our policies, to migrate and then complaining about it, instead we should make sure that people, if they want to be able to stay at home, stay in their home countries that they, can and then open up legal Pathways for, migration instead the Republican, proposals we're dealing with and, actually what they mostly would help is, cartel profits because what they want to, do is close legal pathway ways for, migration force people that we are, helping starve have to move often times, have to pay criminal organizations and, then the Republicans get to complain, about it it is a toxic brew that, Democrats shouldn't be playing into, instead we should say let's open up more, legal Pathways for people to migrate, here let's open up the ability for folks, to ask for parole and get on a plane and, apply and come here and get a work, permit quickly that would Reve a lot of, what you're seeing on the TV Fox TV, cameras on the border and actually make, things better for people in Latin, America and in the United States but, instead we insist on punishing Latin, America pushing people out of their home, countries and then not opening up legal, Pathways for them to migrate Juan I, wanted to put this question to you you, and congressmember Greg casar were part, of a panel yesterday called 200 years is, enough moving past the Monroe Doctrine, toward a new era in US Latin American, relations can you put this current uh, push at this moment right uh because the, house Speaker says they're going to go, home at the end of the week if they, don't get their way on Border Biden is, desperate to get money for Ukraine um, and so we don't know at this point, what's going to happen McConnell says, there's no way they can do this before, Christmas but put this in that broader, 200-year context I mean you wrote that, incredible book that's now a textbook in, so many college classes called Harvest, of Empire um talk about what how this, fits in with the Monroe Doctrine what, that, was well yes well the Monro Doctrine for, 200 years has been the basic policy that, the United States has pursued in uh in, uh the entire Western Hemisphere but, especially toward Latin America telling, European and other Colonial Powers you, stay out of the Western Hemisphere this, is our backyard in essence and it's been, used repeatedly uh by uh US presidents, and and congresses to in to invade uh, countries in Latin America to forment uh, uh clandestine or covert operations to, remove leaders that uh that weren't, sufficiently obedient to the United, States and I think it's uh and it it's, never really been uh repealed or uh uh, or U refuted by uh us leaders I mean it, was a small attempt by John caring, during the Obama Administration to claim, it was uh it was over but president, Trump uh backtracked on that and went, back to the the The Bullying of the, United States and Latin America and I'm, wondering uh Congressman casar your, sense of the prospects for being able to, have a new policy for Latin America uh, in the, future it's time for us to leave that, 200-year Monroe Doctrine Legacy behind, us and I think a small number of, progressives Who start to open up a, window to a new relationship in Latin, America are going to carve the path, forward here because instead of spending, our limited resources on things you've, covered Kanan overthrowing the, government in Guatemala in the 50s the, invasion of Cuba arming Contra rebels in, Nicaragua currently continuing to starve, instead of feed people in places like, Cuba and Venezuela instead of engaging, in that that honestly doesn't help in, Latin America and doesn't help us here, we can create a new partnership I was, just in Chile for uh nearly the, anniversary of us helping overthrow the, Chilean government uh of ayende back in, the day and part of the reason we did, that is because we wanted to protect, United States and Chilean Elites in the, copper industry that was disastrous so, many people died it helped no one but, instead finally we could have a, conversation about in how do we support, democracy and support one another in, Rising authoritarianism how as we head, towards a renewable and climate uh more, resilient future they have instead the, resources for us to create batteries how, do we create those together and make, sure workingclass people in Chile and, the United States benefit not just big, corporations there is a real ability for, us to work with Latin America to tackle, the climate crisis beat back, authoritarianism address migration that, would actually benefit our constituents, in our communities and I think folks, would get reelected on that kind of work, in Latin America rather than continued, invasions and we just have 10 seconds do, you think President Biden hears you what, do you think's going to happen your, prediction congressman, uh what I can tell you for sure is that, you're going to see increased pressure, coming from um Hispanic black and Asian, members of Congress Progressive members, of Congress you're going

intelligence I literally just grab, because I love what you're doing talk, about what gave you the idea for this, well actually black women in AI came, about um because of Usher Usher Usher, the singer Usher the singer I was, attempting to build a robot named Usher, and as I was what was Usher going to do, Usher was going to serve me hot cocoa oh, I love that and in the context of that I, started researching on the internet how, to build this robot and it led to, artificial intelligence and so that was, the Genesis of the thought process and, then I ended up attending an event that, did not fully reflect me but they, continued to talk about artificial in, yes and they continue to talk about how, artificial intelligence is the fourth, Industrial, Revolution and in that moment I said to, myself well surely you can't have a, revolution without black women and so, that what the Genesis of black women in, AI so what's interesting is that your, background is in the oil and gas, industry you're based out of Houston yes, so so how do you start something like, that did you ever build your robot Usher, did not you did not so so you've got, this organization in your mind what was, the mission who are you like black women, in AI could be many forms it could be, women working in AI could be educational, could be a resource for other companies, right what was your, mission black women in artificial, intelligence is a professional, membership organization and our mission, is to educate engage Embrace and Empower, black women in the artificial, intelligence sector and we're making, sure that we're providing access and, opportunities so what's interesting is a, lot of organizations in in AI would, would come to you and they say okay, we're working with black women in, artificial, intelligence what do you say to them are, you interested in that I'm always, interested in engaging and partnering, with different organizations what's, important is that we ask people who come, to us that say we want to partner with, you we ask them to do three things and, the first thing is to know the vision, educate engage Embrace and Empower to, understand the vision educate engage, Embrace and Empower and finally to trust, the vision educate engage Embrace and, Empower because when you trust the, vision you will tell someone else about, it so one of the things you'd noticed, was that the current roster it often is, in Silicon Valley and Tech does not have, a lot of black women but so you know, when you get led into the room we've all, been led into the room, yes and nothing changes what what is the, ultimate goal what's your message cuz a, lot of people people are like oh yeah we, work with all these groups there for, years and years you've been talking, about this what's going to move the, needles I think uh often times there's a, performative aspect to it and one of the, things that I tell people and it's not, always popular is that I'm not really, concerned about a seat at the table you, don't want to seat at the table I don't, want to seat at the table I don't want, to seat at the table without power, Authority and influence I've had a seat,

write uh us we want to, write contracts we want to be able to, look back and say okay now with the, University of Houston we will have nine, doctors at the end of this session and, so that is what we're looking for, something that we can look back and, count as an impact on the community you, want to innovate your way out of, existence I love that angel I I look, forward to continuing the

Trump and now as, stormmy Daniels prepares to testify in, this trial we know, that on the other hand aon's story over, the past few years took a very different, turn the lawyer was convicted on crimes, and fraud related to representing Stormy, Daniels and other clients he was hit, with a severe, 19-year prison sentence in total he is, now incarcerated in California's, terminal Island Federal Correctional, Institution so here's the deal tonight, aanad is both Central to next week's, trial and hard to reach now even though, he was of course a media fixture at the, height of his work for Stormy Daniels, but since going to prison as I mentioned, he has not spoken out in an interview, about this case until now so as this, first ever trial of a former president, begins next week which was just, reaffirmed that scheduled by an appeals, court today as aanat is a very, newsworthy and legally relevant guest he, is speaking out for the first time from, prison on the now historic case he, helped, ignite joining us now by phone is, Michael avanatti the former lawyer to, stormmy Daniels calling in from the, terminal Island federal prison in, California Michael welcome oh it's good, to hear your voice sori uh it's good, good to have you we have a lot of news, to get to uh but first how are you, holding, up well as uh as Elton John once wrote, I'm still standing Ari I'm uh I'm doing, fine and uh you know to those uh who, were hoping that perhaps this the last, few years would uh you know ultimately, destroy me I've got some bad news for, him and that is that it hasn't uh I'm, going to come out of this uh better and, stronger than ever and uh you know every, day I strive to make sure that this does, not define me uh I believe this will be, ultimately you know a chapter in a in a, very long book as opposed to the book, understood uh and you join us at a very, newsworthy time uh some of your, lawyering uh led to the exposure the, evidence in this case uh the New York, trial now will be Donald Trump's first, and possibly only trial this year um how, do you assess the strength of the, prosecution's, case well I think what I'm about to say, is going to surprise a lot of people and, that is that um you know I think this is, the wrong case at the wrong time Ari um, I I think that the case is in many ways, stale at this juncture you're talking, about conduct that occurred some eight, years ago uh I think the fact that it's, occurring in state court in New York uh, is a mistake uh and I think that when, you are going to uh potentially deprive, tens of millions of, Americans of their choice for the, presidency of the United States whether, we agree with those folks or not or, regardless of what we may think of, Donald Trump I think it's a mistake to, do it based on a case of this nature um, I I was hoping frankly that uh there, would have been less hand ringing uh, less bed wedding and that the January, 6th case would have been filed in a more, timely man, there's no excuse or reason as to why, that case could not have been brought in, 2021 and it should have been brought in, 2021 and had it been brought in 2021 we, would not find ourselves in the, situation that we're in right now now I, know a lot of people have been critical, of the United States Supreme Court and, uh as well as the second uh not the, second but the DC circuit y you know I I, think those complaints are Frank, misplaced and Michael have you been in, touch with da Bragg's office and what, specifically in in evidence or logic uh, do you think is wrong with this case, well I'm going to decline to answer as, to whether I've been in touch with you, know either the defense or um the DA's, office but but let me say this in, response to the second part of your, question you know I I I think the the, case has a lot of problems now that that, does not I don't mean to suggest that, that means that Trump will not be, convicted because I think he will be, convicted because number because number, one he's a criminal defendant and in our, society I don't believe the criminal, defendants generally get a fair Shake in, fact I think that the percentage of, convictions demonstrates that that the, deck is stacked decidedly against all, criminal defendants um number one number, two I don't think that he can get a fair, trial in New York and to the people who, claim that in fact he can get a fair, trial in New York with the new York jury, I would ask them if they were to sleep, go to sleep tonight and wake up tomorrow, and find out that the case had been, moved to Mississippi or Alabama would, they still think that the trial was, going to be fair and I think if they, were being honest they would answer no, so I don't think he can get a fair trial, in in New York but separate apart from, that I I think the case does have, problems I mean number one I don't know, who the narrator Witnesses are going to, be in the case and by that I mean that, that every case needs to have one or two, primary Witnesses who tell the story, from my perspective uh I surmise that, the da is going to use potentially, Michael Cohen or stormmy Daniels for, that purpose um and and I think that has, the potential to be a, disaster Michael Cohen is a and you know, I've never been a fan of of Michael for, various reasons um you know he's he's a, Serial liar he's shown himself to be, incapable of telling the truth um you, know his legal Acumen leaves a lot to be, desired I mean let's just say that if, you know if Learned Hand or Clarence, daro had a lovech child it it certainly, wouldn't be someone like Michael Cohen, Trump claims that he just paid retainer, money um and now it's being prosecuted, as basically financial fraud lying about, the expense you have a lot of experience, in this case is Donald Trump lying when, he says it was all going to just be a, retainer yeah I don't believe that I've, never believed it and if you go back and, look at the interview views in fact that, you and I conducted back in 2018 I I've, always scoffed at that and thought it, was ridiculous but my point is one just, of trial Dynamics who's going to tell, the story and the problem is is that if, the prosecution relies predominantly on, Michael Cohen and you know documents, don't admit themselves into evidence you, know I see various legal commentators, talk about well this is a document case, well that may be true to a certain, degree but you've still got to have, somebody on the stand that tells the, story, and and to say that Michael Cohen is a, uh is a problem witness uh would be an, understatement I mean and look here's, the other issue Ari you know Alina ABBA, is not going to be trying this case for, Donald Trump now I don't know how he got, him but he got real lawyers in this case, and these lawyers know their way around, a courtroom and I think they're going to, have an absolute field day with Michael, Cohen on the stand well let me ask you, this Michael because you said some, people might be, surprised uh that you Michael aanat, speaking us today uh see all the, weakness in this case I I do want to, remind you that uh back when you were, involved you said Trump should have, liability you said Federal prosecutors, in New York should present this material, to Grand Jury for potential indictment, of trump when he was president um so how, can you explain uh going from that then, uh to what you're saying tonight that, you actually think this is a a troubled, case well I can explain it this way Ari, I and you're absolutely right I wrote an, oped in the New York Times in 2018 in, October uh which predated the criminal, investigation Into Me by about 10 days, coincidentally enough and I don't, believe in coincidences I wrote that, oped and I advocated for the indictment, of then sitting president Donald Trump, and I stand by that 100% I advocated for, federal prosecutors in the southern, district of New York to bring campaign, finance charges and by the way no cogent, explanation has ever been provided by, anybody as to who made that decision and, why they didn't bring those charges, either while he was president or, immediately thereafter and I think, that's a question that people need to, ask the problem that I have with this, case now I have a number of problems, first of all cases are not like fine red, wine Ari they don't get better with age, um and this case hasn't gotten better, with age number two I don't believe this, case belongs in state court and I think, it rests on a legally tenuous Theory, namely that the crime that was attempted, to be covered up was a federal election, crime I think that could be a problem, potentially on appeal um for the state, um and number three let me slow you down, and then you'll go to number three but, you're just to be clear saying that with, your knowledge of all of this if the da, is trying to make this stick as a felony, as a serious matter based on, Federal rather than State Crime you, think that could be a hole in the whole, theory of this case I I do and I think, it's going to be tested on appeal um, when Trump is convicted and again I, think he will be convicted that doesn't, necessarily mean um it's going to hold, up I believe if you're going to bring a, case against a sitting president or a, former president who tens of millions of, people support especially in today's day, and age with how divided we are I think, it needs to be a rock solid Lo lock, tight nearly perfect prosecuted case, because otherwise you run a huge risk as, to what it's going to mean for the, country and I don't believe this case, right now is the case and that's the, problem that I have but I stand behind, everything I said in 2018 everything I, wrote in that oped and and I remain very, concerned that no one has gotten to the, bottom of what the hell exactly happened, with SD and Y in 2018 was that decision, made by Jeffrey Burman was that decision, made by William bar who made that, decision and why was it made to turn a, blind eye to Donald Trump's conduct well, Michael you mentioned your history you, also uh wrote that there are facts and, evidence text emails Etc in the hush, money case that have yet to see the, light of day that will be quote very, damaging to the prosecution uh have, those sents seen the light of day what, are you referring, to well I'm I'm going to be careful, about what's been disclosed and and who, it's been disclosed to um I don't know, ultimately uh if they will see the light, of day during the trial but you know Ari, over the course of the representation my, representation of Miss Daniels I came to, learn a number of things, unfortunately uh from her that turned, out to be completely, untrue uh and a lot of that is what led, me to terminate my representation of her, in February of of, 2019 one of the big things that I, learned unfortunately is that what I had, been sold by Miss Daniels relating to, how this payment had came about and what, I had subsequently advocated on, television and others in Reliance on, what she had told me turned out to be, completely false uh it had been, represented to me that she had not, attempted to extort Donald Trump uh and, the campaign in the waning days of 2016, that they had come to her uh and I, believed her when she told me that, repeatedly unfortunately in early 2019 I, came to learn that that was not true, does it matter to the legal case who, initiated it if as you said earlier, tonight Donald Trump still lied about it, and potentially lied to the government, about it I don't think from a legal, perspective it matters but I think very, well from an Optics standpoint it could, matter and again I believe he'll be, convicted in the case but I don't think, it's going to move the needle to the, degree that some people believe that it, will I think a lot of this is already, baked into the analysis relating for, instance to the campaign I mean I've, seen the polls and I've seen the the the, pundants talk about that if he's, criminally convicted it's going to uh, it's going to be meaningful as it, relates the presidential election I, don't think that's going to be true if, he's convicted in this particular case, let me ask you this Michael you've, thrown some cold water on what some, people thought was a strong case here, and and you've also given your analysis, of what may happen and we'll all be, watching uh at the same time you have, implied that your treatment uh by the, then bar and Trump justice department uh, was harsher than other people may have, uh been dealt with if they weren't in, your position you had become for a time, a very prominent foe of then president, Trump um do you say tonight that that, there is evidence that you were treated, differently and if so does that mean, anything for what a second term Trump, doj might look like if he were, elected I I don't believe there's any, question that I was treated differently, and I believe that if anyone is asked, that honestly and looks at what happened, here and if they're honest in their, answer I believe that they would answer, the same way that I have Ari I was, indicted in three separate cases within, 54 days the government proceeded to, stack these sentences on top of one, another I was not treated fairly and I, was treated um differently and I firmly, believe and will go to my grave, believing uh that one of the reasons the, reason I was treated in this fashion was, because I was the biggest enemy uh of, Donald Trump in 2018 there's no question, about that and I was also his most, dangerous enemy and finally what do you, say to people listening tonight who, think well even if that's the case and, there was differential treatment uh you, still work caught and at times expressed, uh you know Contrition uh for crimes and, crimes related to dishonesty why should, people take your word on any of this, tonight well because I think I, demonstrated over a significant period, of time and over a couple decades um of, legal work that I've done a lot of good, uh that a lot of what I've said has, checked out uh that I generally have not, trafficked in nonsense there's no, question Ari that I made mistakes, there's no question uh that I exercise, poor judgment uh at times uh but there's, no question that I exercise poor, Judgment at times uh but I I think, people need to ask yourself or, themselves are you really going to, Define Somebody by the worst thing they, did in their life or are you going to, look at the totality of the body of, their work and what advice would you, give to anyone and how to make sense of, this trial as it, unfolds well I I think it's going to be, a circus it's certainly going to be, entertaining uh and uh you know you're, going to have your work cut out for you, but from what I've seen you're certainly, going to be you're certainly going to be, up uh to the task uh and uh again it's, been a pleasure to speak with you, Michael avanatti thank you very much for, joining us, tonight declin to answer is to whether, I've been in touch with you know either, the defense or um the DA's office is, Donald Trump lying when he says it was, all going to just be a retainer yeah I, don't believe that and I've never, believed it and if you go back and look, at the interviews in fact that you and I, conducted back in 2018 I've always, scoffed at that and and thought it was, ridiculous a ridiculous Trump defense, there as fact check by Michael aanat he, just spoke out with us from prison, tonight he's been on his own path from, lawyer to inmate he's eyeing this trial, next week on the issues that whatever, you think of him and we discussed some, of the legal problems and convictions, he's had he did ignite all of this six, years ago in the way that he represented, Stormy Daniels aad newsworthy remarks, from prison and next week's trial are, not strictly a legal matter they also, involve this unprecedented American, story and the repercussions could go, from New York to DC to the campaign, Trail so we go beyond the courtroom now, with one of our journalistic political, experts Wasing monthly Margaret Carlson, welcome hello R what an interview kudos, to you thank you uh I don't know how you, got I don't know how you got him to talk, from prison but congratulations thank, you Margaret uh as I mentioned this, applies to many witnesses we've heard, from over the years um their legal, status May Merit criticism people may, have strong views understandably and yet, there's a reason why so many prosecutors, and others have have spoken with them, and gathered their evidence these people, uh were in really Central roles and so, I'm curious what you thought of what, Michael alanti said there both um not, just on the law but his View and he has, some understanding of of the sort of, public perceptions of media um about the, fact that this is not necessarily an, airtight case uh for the public about, Donald Trump's alleged, wrongdoing well it it may not be it, looks to you know it looks to I think, normal people easier to understand than, the documents cases and and maybe even, the January 6th case um because it's you, know it's it's it's I don't know, Hollywood Housewives kind of kind of, case and I'm disappointed in that it is, the first case and it's the todry one it, doesn't go to the real, uh uh problems that that Donald Trump uh, presents to the country uh at the, beginning of the interview he said he, was going to surprise you and I didn't, notice any surprise on your face because, you know once we learned about Michael, avanatti who was just ever, present um he I mean he's comparing, himself to Michael Cohen favorably and I, don't remember Michael Cohen defrauding, a, paraplegic um and I and stealing I mean, $300,000 is a lot to steal from anybody, and Stormy Daniels didn't appear to be, sitting that high in the income level uh, it it's like astonishing but you I mean, we can't be surprised that he now, doesn't think this is the right case at, the right time because he's not in it, he's not Central anymore he's sitting in, a prison and it probably was a relief to, him to have a a a a a platform to talk, about it because not sitting in a chair, as councel and he's probably not even, going to be a witness for the reason, that he said Michael Cohen wouldn't make, a good witness and that's because he's a, fraud and a liar and a, cheat yeah I hear your criticism there, which is rooted as we mentioned earlier, about repeat and sometimes viewers come, in and out as you get ready for dinner, on the East Coast that uh I mentioned, this to him in our interview I asked him, about it he's been convicted of crimes, related to dishonesty um and Mr Cohen's, crimes uh were chiefly on behalf of, Donald Trump and he ultimately, cooperated with them although there were, also we should mention some tax issues, um I do know and I can say to share with, viewers as we have a little more time, now uh there are a whole range of media, requests I I happen to know from Mr, aanat so we were able to arrange this, prison phone call over time um but I, would not be surprised if you saw him in, other media soon because he's just such, a clearly newsworthy figure here uh Mr, Cohen uh of course has been on this, program and others I should mention, tonight he's posting online rebutting, some of what aadia says and an open, invite out to him to come on uh and, respond directly U but here's a little, bit of that point you reference of what, aanat was saying about Cohen and, Witnesses every case needs to have one, or two primary Witnesses who tell the, story from my perspective uh I surmise, that the da is going to use potentially, Michael Cohen or stormmy Daniels for, that purpose um and and I think that has, the potential to be a, disaster Michael Cohen is a you know, I've never been a fan of of Michael for, various reasons um you know he's he's a, Serial liar he's shown himself to be, incapable of telling the, truth, Margaret well um as you said he he told, he he he lied in the interest of a, candidate and a president uh which is M, much different than what Michael aanat, did he was always lying and cheating on, his on his own behalf um and Michael, Cohen I think makes a good witness I saw, his Congressional testimony he's not a, bad witness and he's repentant I don't, see any repentance from Michael aanat, did you um well I'll just say and let, you finish uh I wouldn't describe him as, overly contrite if you're asking for my, observation um but through the legal, process he did on record in court um say, that he that he was contrite and he did, go through that process and we've seen, others not do that so people can draw, their own conclusions but he's he made, an effort to say that in public well, that happens in court I mean when my, parents were about to discipline me I, was suddenly very contrite uh but I, don't I don't think he feels it um, because even in the way he spoke with, you he's and oh here's one thing I I do, think went too far yes he should be, punished because he you know Nike, Kimberly Clark the the the four clients, he smaller clients like the paric he he, defrauded I don't think he should have, put been put in a cell with a drug lord, that strikes me as the kind of thing, that that someone might do as an extra, little bit of punishment hey everyone, MSNBC has a new and improved app you'll, get real time alerts and Analysis live, blogs

special counsel Jack Smith has now, just moments ago we just got this, printed here in our Newsroom filed his, reply to Donald Trump's effort to stop, the trial and the win that Jack Smith, got in that appeals court uh they are, citing Donald Trump's alleged effort to, perpetuate himself in power the charged, crimes strike at the heart of our, democracy and Smith says the Supreme, Court should not stay or delay this case, that the trial should commence on the, plan schedule which means if he won Jack, Smith filing this tonight that trial, could begin in a matter of weeks um this, is the big case everyone's been watching, we have a very special guest who agreed, to jump in unscheduled because we are, following two breaking news stories, Andrew Weissman has experienced in, exactly these kind of probes he served, in the Müller special councel probe he, was FBI general counsel he knows these, uh cases quite well Andrew uh, welcome good good morning good afternoon, I should say I'm busy um reading as you, can tell um because I there's a 39 page, filing that was made just moments ago by, Jack, Smith so let's start uh in that filing, and that's why we go to you in terms of, reading it one of the basic uh kind of, Baseline points that Jack Smith makes, early uh and that you have to make uh in, this kind of case if you're if you're, appealing to say no don't delay don't, stay it he says and I'm going to S say, this in plain English and then you can, uh be area and walk us through it uh, Jack Smith says with all confidence we, won at the district level we won in the, appeals court we expect to win the legal, issues here so because we are likely to, win uh we should not be paused or, punished in the process of defending our, wins and therefore there shouldn't be a, stay um explain that Baseline opening, argument here absolutely so um the first, thing to note is this tells you how, important for Jack Smith speed is um he, had until next Tuesday to make his, filing but um as we I think all expected, he was not going to take the full amount, of time and indeed just took one day uh, to to put this uh 39 page submission uh, in I may have the pages slightly wrong, but it's a, substantial uh uh uh submission um and, what he's saying is Donald Trump has, asked for a continued stay of the judge, chuin Tri, and that is that is the main issue that, Jack Smith needs to win on in other, words even if the court wants to accept, this to hear the appeal to decide, whether there should be this um absolute, immunity claim and I think everyone, thinks there's no way the Supreme Court, even if they take this case it's going, to be to reverse the district court and, the court of appeals it would really to, be affirm it they're saying do not stay, the case let judge chuin go forward, because indeed there won't be a trial, any day now it won't be happening, imminently um because judge chuen needs, to do a lot of pre-trial work even if, there was a green light immediately so, this is really a plea for the Supreme, Court whatever it does whether it, decides not to take the case whether it, decides to take the case do not issue a, stay um because there'll be ample time, even in the worst case scenario for the, court to issue its decision but to let, judge cheu go forward to prepare the, case for trial because otherwise what, you're really doing is granting um, essentially um in a sort of a stage, whisper or subsentio as we would say, legally um that you're really saying um, there will be no legal accountability in, this case for Donald Trump yeah I think, you've just underlined that the headline, here being we're talking about the, timeline the calendar of this coup trial, and Jack Smith won in the district court, he won won the appeal um we have no, reason to think that in the end he would, lose uh at least you know it could, narrow it slightly but we don't expect, the Supreme Court to suddenly announc, that um former presidents um are are, superhuman people with license to Kill, and all the rest and so what Jack Smith, has done tonight right now here with the, new filing is say um don't make the, mistake of delaying us which would, actually potentially as you explained, undercut the whole thing uh Andrew, Eisman stays with us uh he is literally, the perfect guest you could have on the, prosecution side of this breaking news, news on the appeal side on how the, Supreme Court makes these fine grain, distinctions I would argue MSNBC now as, the other perfect guest uh former acting, solicit general United States Neil kacha, uh thank you for jumping in here I know, both of you have been waiting on this as, have we so Neil I'm just going to read, from that same point I was discussing, with Andrew and that I'm curious, anything else you want to educate us on, um but right up top um we see Jack, Smith's filing say with regard to Trump, trying to delay um Trump cannot show as, he must to get the win to get a delay, quote a fair Prospect of success in this, court and then he goes on to write Trump, cannot show the balance of equities, lawyers speak for what's good or not is, this a good idea or not um or the public, interest quote favors continued delay of, this criminal proceeding of this Trump, trial that's planned uh walk us through, that Neil and and as I said anything, else yeah so remember Donald Trump lost, his Claim about absolute immunity, resoundingly before our nation's second, highest court last week the DC circuit, and that group of Judges included a very, conservative really well-respected judge, and he lost every vote on that and he, lost it every which way you possibly can, so Donald Trump's lawyers have now gone, already to the Supreme Court and are, basically asking two things one that the, absolute immunity claim be reversed that, the Supreme Court hear the case and, reverse and say the Donald Trump has, absolute immunity and number two that he, gets what we call a stay which is, basically he wants to delay his criminal, trial until after the US Supreme Court, rules and Jack Smith was given a week, Yesterday by the US Supreme Court to, respond to this stay request Smith took, one day because as this really terrific, 35 Plus page violing shows it just kind, of wrote itself and basically Smith is, making a few arguments number one that, in order to get a stay in order for, Trump to delay he's got to convince a, majority of the Supreme Court that the, court of appeals decision is likely to, be reversed and on that Smith is just so, good in saying no chance let me just, read to you one quote from this brief, Trump's position finds no support in, constitutional text separation of powers, principles history or even logic and if, the radical claim were accepted it up on, understandings presidential, accountability that have prevailed, throughout history while undermining, democracy and the rule of law, particularly where as here a former, president is alleged to have committed, crimes to stay in office despite losing, an election thereby seeking to subvert, constitutional procedures for, transferring the power and to, disenfranchise millions of Voters that's, a remarkable claim to be made against a, former president in a brief to the, United States Supreme Court by our, justice department but that's what this, is about and Jack Smith is not mincing, any words so that's the first point that, there's a likelihood that there's no, likelihood that Trump's going to get, this and then he goes on for page after, page it's just devastating already, explaining why Trump's claim fails, constitutional logic principles and the, like and then the last thing and I think, we're going to hear a lot about this at, the very end Smith says look Supreme, Court if you want to hear this case hear, it quickly expedite the appeal we ready, to go in March and we want you to decide, it that quickly um Let me let me read, that and then and then you can break it, down I'm curious uh Andrew's reaction as, well because that's the plan B here I, just want to reset as we do around the, news because I got two super smart uh, fast talking lawyers here uh the, breaking news is that Jack Smith has now, stepped up and very quickly appe you, know filed his Supreme Court filing I'm, telling the Supreme Court we won we want, to put Trump on trial we don't accept, any delay we don't think this should be, delayed stayed uh and both of our, lawyers here are with me on that and so, Neil um that's basically plan a plan B, you just alluded to um which he, basically Jack Smith says full steam, ahead green light the coup trial then he, says if you must review this uh if you, feel the Supreme Court that somehow um, the doj is wrong that there's some, reason you got to get into it case of, first impression things we've heard, we've heard from attorney general holder, about that recently on the show he says, and I apologize to the viewers here I'm, just going to read right off this we, don't have it it's so new we don't have, it yet for the screen but he says if the, court believes that Trump must have this, me this review at this time I'm reading, from middle of Page Three to both of you, um the government then the doj asked to, treat this petition as a rid of of cersi, orari basically that you would review, the whole thing the case and then have, expedited briefing and then Jack Smith, says a fast schedule would permit the, court to quote issue its opinion and, judgment resolving the immunity issue as, promptly as possible this term so that, if the court Rejects Trump's immunity, claim a timely and fair trial can begin, with minimal additional delay I believe, that's part of what you referring to, Neil so so break that down for us and, then answer I I think what we're likely, to hear from the Republicans who are, trying to defend Trump is look Jack, Smith is signaling weakness here he's, saying the Supreme Court should set an, expedited briefing schedule not deny to, hear the case that's not what Smith is, saying there are 36 pages of this brief, that say supr Supreme Court there is, absolutely nothing here don't hear this, case Jack Smith's filing today Ari is, really powerful it basically just says, every which way you look at it Donald, Trump loses there's nothing here for the, US Supreme Court to really look at and, certainly no re no reason to delay a, criminal trial I mean when you and I if, you and I were ever indicted we wouldn't, get to run to the US Supreme Court and, stop our criminal trial because we had, some legal quibble with what's going on, you have to go through the trial first, and that's basically what Smith is, saying here and he's saying there's a, massive cost on the other side that if, you give this delay then you are going, to interfere with this criminal trial to, the point where it may never happen now, what we were talking about before um we, got interrupted by the by the police, chief's press conference was the last, couple pages of Jack Smith's brief 36, pages are Supreme Court there's nothing, here there are three pages that that do, the responsible thing for a supreme, court Advocate what they're saying is, look if you disagree Supreme Court and, you think there's something to hear here, then you should hear it really fast so, fast that Trump will have 10 days to, file their brief Jack Smith will have, seven to file his response Trump will, have five days to hear file his response, to Jack Smith's papers and then oral, argument within about a month from now, that is the thing you do you I've, written these briefs to the US Supreme, Court in these big cases um that's the, responsible thing to do which is to, signal to the Supreme Court which you, called already be an argument in the, alternative it's not at all a sign of, weakness by Smith at all it's an, incredibly muscular brief but that's, what those last three pages are about no, I ju it jumped out to you and and I, quoted from it earlier because it's very, interesting to see I mean this is high, stakes uh and the Trump folks have their, strategy and it's partially delayed and, it's partially leaning on arguments that, might never win uh but could buy them, time and so that plan B gives you the, Strategic rebuttal to that uh I wanted, to play for you something very briefly, from the former Attorney General Eric, Holder uh who ran the doj you've served, in high positions at the doj um because, he joined me this week and talked about, this argument that the Trump people he, says are projecting as always they, accuse others uh of of somehow they're, being a two-tiered system when in fact, Trump's entire argument is having a tier, not two tiers but a Trump Tier where, where he gets an exception that nobody, else gets here Congressman we just heard, the the mayor there mayor Lucas um do, what so many public officials have to do, these days uh he spoke about the, emergency and how you deal with that he, oversees the police he's got to deal, with all of the victims um but in a very, I thought restrained or thoughtful way, he alluded to what we're all living, through and what is a part of daily life, in America uh which is the ready access, to guns in the way that they POS a, danger to everyone else whether you have, a gun or not uh you're in danger whether, you're had a parade or not um and he, spoke about how the police many of them, that he the mayor credited bravely uh, ran towards the danger but a danger that, he said as a factual matter is greater, uh because of the ready access to guns, in America um your response uh and then, Jamal I mean he's 100% right and you, know before Congress I used to work on a, lot of events some of the biggest events, in our country and I can tell you for a, fact that Municipal governments event, planners this is at the top of people's, minds when they're planning an event but, there's only so much you can do when we, have way more guns than people in this, country the proliferation of Guns is, completely out of hand and we have, politicians that are encouraging people, to arm up and then spewing racial, bigotry conspiracy theories that push, and radicalize people to do things and, obviously we're still figuring out what, the motive is we don't know at this, point but this is going on around the, country it's the damn guns we need to, make sure that we pass legislation to, help ensure that we can curve back gun, violence in this country so that way you, can go to a parade to celebrate the win, of your team and not have to worry about, being shot this is another example and, keep in mind today is the sixe, remembrance of the mass shooting that, happened in Parkland at margorie stowman, Douglas where 17 people were shot and, killed and I saw there was another, shooting that happened in Georgia at, some school gun violence we cannot allow, this to become normalized because it's, not, normal well unfortunately I think we're, already at the point where this is, normalized and um today we saw America's, two biggest obsessions on display, football and gun violence and if you, hear the side of gun enthusiasts they, will tell you that the more people who, are armed the safer we are okay well, Missouri uh is a state where there's, virtually no limit on getting a gun no, background checks no training no red, flag no domestic violence gun laws no, limit on assault weapons magazines no, waiting period so everybody there can, carry we also had a situation where you, had over 800 officers at a parade and, yet and still the outcome Remains the, Same because the part we don't want to, deal with Remains the Same and that is, the access to guns and uh I guess I've, given up a little bit hope a little bit, of Hope and I thought that maybe we'll, reach a bottom maybe we'll come to a, point where we all agree like okay, enough is enough and it's unfortunate, because so many people have lost their, lives up until this point but we won't, come to that point because we've seen, children killed we've seen people uh you, know victimized by gun VI violence at, every in churches in at parades now uh, large Gatherings small Gatherings we've, seen every manner of this type of, violence and yet we're clinging to this, Red Dawn fantasy that is literally, killing people by the day it's the, biggest epidemic we have going on in, this country right now and I think, people have reached the point, particularly our politicians who um not, all of them and certainly not the, congressman that I'm on with now but, they have reached to the point where, they're getting a perverse thrill by, inciting that people get more guns and, behave in certain ways that only expand, this problem so I hate to say it but I, think America has really given up when, it has come to gun, violence","shortTranscript":"the part we don't want to deal with,

matchup of the year is set and, it's a rematch of 2020 it's the same, teams even it's the red team versus the, other red team that's right the Kansas, City Chiefs are set to face off yet, again against the San Francisco 49ers in, Super Bowl, 58 okay all right if you thought that, was a windup to the likely battle, between President Biden Donald Trump in, 2024 well it is also that, too and that is because bear with me, here a segment of right-wing media is, convinced that the Kansas City Chiefs, qualifying for the Super Bowl this year, is actually a vast left-wing, conspiracy this plot all centers around, the relationship between Kansas City, tight end Travis Kelce and Superstar, musician Taylor Swift a relationship the, right-wing now believes is actually a, deep state conspiracy to elect Joe Biden, I am not, kidding Taylor Swift a government, scop now it is possible that Taylor, Swift quite frankly does not know that, she is being utilized in a covert manner, to swing voters last year a single, Instagram post led to 35,000 new voter, registrations think about this uh cley, 45,000 Battleground state votes decide, the last election so it does matter, there's that poll where 18% of the, electorates says they would follow her, endorsement and three out of 10 people, under 35 isn't it interesting she just, so happens to be dating Kansas City, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce better, known as Mr fizer oh who's now also, going to the Super Bowl let's be real, here this is bread and circuses on, steroids former presidential candidate, and current Trump Lackey VI ramaswami, described the conspiracy this way I I, wonder who's going to win the Super bowl, next month and I wonder if there's a, major presidential endorsement coming, from an artificially propped up couple, this, fall okay now first of all the Kansas, City Chiefs have made it to three of the, last four Super Bowls so the fact that, they made it again this year is not only, not a conspiracy it is not even, surprising even to people who only watch, football once a year like, me but beyond that the idea that the US, government tricked Taylor Swift into, getting political with a deep State sigh, up that idea ignores the actual, verifiable reason Taylor Swift decided, to go public with her politics in the, first place here she is in the, documentary Miss Americana talking about, why she decided to make her first ever, political statement in more than a, decade of, Fame these aren't your dad's celebrities, and these aren't your dad's Republicans, imagine if we came to you and said hey, we've got this idea that we could har, the number of people that come to next, to us the other thing just from a, security Taylor Swift comes out against, Trump I don't care if they write that, that was Taylor Swift in 2018 right, after that scene Taylor Swift endorsed, the Democratic competitor to Republican, Marsha Blackburn in the Tennessee Senate, race clearly Miss Swift knew that she, could lose fans over that decision but, this wasn't about popularity and it, wasn't because the Democratic deep State, spiked her coffee Taylor Swift got, political because it seems she actually, cared about the issues here she is, talking about why she couldn't support, Marsha Blackburn in that Senate, race it really is a big deal to me she, votes against against fair pay for women, she votes against the reauthorization of, the of the violence against women act, which is just basically protecting us, from domestic abuse and stock, stalking she votes she thinks that that, if you're a gay couple or even if you, look like a gay couple you should be, allowed to be kicked out of a restaurant, it's really basic human rights and it's, right and wrong at this point and I, can't see another, commercial and see her disguising these, policies behind the words Tennessee, Christian values those aren't Tennessee, Christian values I live in Tennessee I, am Christian that's not what we stand, for so that is why Taylor Swift waited, into politics and that is why in 2020, she endorsed Joe Biden for, president and as it turns out getting, political does not seem to have hurt, Taylor Swift in the years since she, endorsed Biden in 2020 Taylor Swift has, gone on what is arguably one of the most, successful tours ever all around the, globe she is selling out the biggest, venues imaginable her concerts are so, popular that the Federal Reserve say as, her tour literally boosted the national, economy so why can't the right believe, that Taylor Swift is just naturally, popular and naturally believes the thing, she believes why can't the right believe, that the Kansas City Chiefs got to the, Super Bowl because they're just really, good at football why can't they believe, that two popular foxy celebrities might, actually just want to date Each, Other Well usually when someone comes up, with a conspiracy theory it's because, they don't want to believe the truth in, this case I think Republic ANS and the, Trump team in particular don't want to, believe how grossly unpopular their, policies are and instead of changing, their unpopular policies they are, doubling down on them we see in poll, after poll that upwards of 60% of, Americans support the right to an, abortion abortion access is incredibly, popular and yet new reporting out of, Politico today shows that right-wing, organizations are already drafting, executive orders for Trump to sign on, day one if he is reelected orders that, would outlaw the most common form of, medication abortion and bar Americans, from being able to get abortion, medications in the, mail while 57% of Americans say they, would not vote for Donald Trump if he, was convicted of a felony Rolling Stone, is out with new reporting this week that, Donald Trump is plotting a way to give, presidents legal immunity for Life, assuming he is, reelected the list goes on while the, majority of Americans support the, Affordable Care Act Trump says wants to, repeal it while the majority of, Americans didn't support Trump's 2017, corporate tax cuts Trump says he wants, to pass a new round of them if he is, reelected Republicans don't want to own, up to the reality that their ideas are, hugely, unpopular and that what they are doing, right now today is making their party, more and more unpopular every day so, rather than accept the reality the right, has created its own reality and in doing, so the right is kind of telling on, itself because this isn't just a, standalone conspiracy theory here this, is part of the big lie Trump allies are, laying the groundwork to claim that if, they lose if Trump loses it's not, because his party dug itself into a Hole, by pushing unpopular policies it's, because Taylor Swift is a deep State, asset it's all rigged in ways you can't, imagine it's because the famously, liberal pentagon is rigging the famously, liberal, NFL it's Hugo Chavez and the Venezuelans, flipping the votes it's Italian, satellites hacking the, vote come on to paraphrase Taylor Swift, here I'm sorry Republicans but you're, the problem it's, you I don't need the money you probably, see the cash we have a lot of cash I, believe we have uh substantially an, excess of 400 million cash $400 million, that is how much available cash Donald, Trump told New York prosecutors his, business had as of last spring now there, is no way to verify that figure and, there is no particular reason we should, believe Mr Trump but one thing we do, know is that he may need at least that, much money and possibly even more to pay, for the verdicts he is facing in, multiple courtrooms Donald Trump is now, on the hook for 80 $3.3 million which a, jury ordered him to pay writer egene, Carroll for defaming her and at any, moment we could get a judgment in, Trump's civil fraud trial where the New, York attorney general is asking for him, to be fined $370, million the judge in that case judge and, Goron has already found that Trump, committed fraud and has even suggested, he may Force Trump to liquidate his, businesses as part of his ultimate, verdict as we await that judgment we are, learning more about Mr Trump's, questionable business practices an, outside monitor appointed by judge, andoran her name is Barbara Jones has, just found several issues with Trump's, business practices including missing, disclosures math errors and questions, about a $48 million loan between Mr, Trump and one of his companies and they, are issues that that outside monitor, says may reflect a lack of adequate, internal controls joining me now is, Devin Barrett justice department, reporter and co-author of the Trump, trials newsletter it is indispensable, over at the Washington Post also with me, is former Federal prosecutor Christy, Greenberg christe the New York Times, reports on this Barbara Jones finding, about what is it questionable business, practices accounting practices adequate, internal controls don't listen to me um, and they say this is precisely the kind, of data point that judge and Goron May, sort of fixate on if you will to really, call for Trump to be find a sizable, amount of money do you think that that, is ACC accurate analysis so I think it, will go not necessarily towards the fine, amount I think it will go towards the, question of whether this lifetime ban, this corporate death penalty gets, imposed because one of the things the, court is looking at is what is the, likelihood of a future violation of this, company and to whether or not there, should be a lifetime ban of trump from, ever engaging in real estate again and, so here judge you know judge Jones now, the independent monitors saying actually, you don't have a compliance Department, you never did an internal investigation, when there was fraud you had a CFO who, pled to fraud a controller who said he, ateed an Abed of fraud you didn't fire, them instead you gave them handsome, Severance packages to not cooperate with, law enforcement and then I'm looking and, I'm finding all of these errors all of, these disclosures that are incomplete or, inconsistent and you don't have a, framework where I can feel confident as, the monitor that that you're not going, to continue to do this if I don't have, my oversight and that seems like a very, logical conclusion given the fact fact, that they haven't fixed anything about, how their organization is set up and, what these inter internal controls are, right if you've can if you you if you, have deemed that the Trump organization, has committed fraud and then in current, in the current day is still sort of, practicing fast and loose accounting, schemes then potentially you say it's, time for you to hang up your shingle and, go home but um delin the AP has a report, a really interesting report on how, unusual it would be for a judge to order, something like that in this case given, the fact that um there's not a showing, of obvious victims and major losses I'll, read the excerpt an AP analysis of, nearly 70 years of civil cases under the, law showed that such a penalty has only, been imposed a dozen previous times and, Trump's case stands apart in a, significant way it's the only big, business found that was threatened with, a shutdown without a showing of again, obvious victims and major losses this is, sort of the argument that Trump's, lawyers have been making to the court, isn't it it absolutely is and it speaks, to I think a a basic disconnect between, what the court system including the, independent monitor Barbara Jones is is, drawing attention to and the way that, the Trump organization has worked for, decades and that is it is the Trump, organization is in some ways a, multi-million dollar organization that, operates like a mom and pop grocery, store and a lot of what the the, independent monitor Barbara Jones a, former federal judge I might add is, flagging is the fact that like this is, not a large company that behaves like a, large company this is a large company, that behaves like a family small, business and she is finding what she, thinks are problems in their accounting, and what the Trump organization is, saying in reply is this is nonsense, you're you're quibbling you're you're, you're focusing on like Petty things and, it and it's unfair and that is the basic, conf conflict in this issue yeah I mean, they've also said like oh Barbara Jones, is trying to basically make a case for, us to continue using her Services by, saying that you, know we're not doing a good job which, makes no sense just taking a step back, Trump recommended Barbara Jones to be, the independent she was agreed upon by, both parties she was agreed upon by both, parties she was a former federal judge, she's not seeking to enrich herself here, I think in the papers one of Trump's, lawyers said she was like jav from lame, is and that you know this obsessive, police officer who's seeking to go after, valon it's like Donald Trump's not valon, Von stole a loaf of bread he is engaged, in persistent fraud that's found by the, judge and so this idea of trying to, malign judge Jones I mean that is not, going to work she's independent she's, not on either side she's calling it like, she sees it um you know Devin I I do, think when we talk about I mean the the, the the penalty here I mean there's the, $370 million but then the the the ending, of the Trump business in New York would, be a devastating blow to Donald Trump's, ego and potentially his pocketbook this, is not the only hit he's taking there is, more reporting that um from the times, that he has spent $50 million in donor, money on legal bills and I just wonder I, know you're reporting on a lot of these, trials like given first of all how, prolonged this calendar is getting how, sustainable you think this is from a, sort of inflow outflow, perspective well so I think it's really, important point because I think what, you're seeing is we are right now in the, moment where the the legal costs of, being Donald Trump are eclipsing his, political operation up till now what, we've seen is his political operation, funding his legal bills up including, some of the penalties that are, associated with the egene Carroll case, but when you see the $83 million verdict, when you see the the expected angeron, decision which is likely to be a lot of, money as well well what you're seeing is, there is no way his political operation, can absorb the costs of those things so, right now what we're seeing is very, important because it's the moment when, the costs of his Pol political career is, impacting his business life and he cares, a great deal about the money and so what, we're seeing I I hope people understand, is that this is now starting to bite in, a way that that his political career has, never bit in his business life before, yeah I mean the and and by the way the, thing that I think he feels the most is, the pain in his wallet right more than I, don't know the the moral indignities of, that he this it's upon the American, public um um chrisy when we talk about, you know the the road ahead and where, the lawyers are going to be needed the, most the federal election interference, case against Donald Trump has been, stayed since December 13th which is a, long time I think the hearing was on, January 9th but still this was some, people thought this was kind of a proor, exercise like this is a ridiculous claim, it'll be over soon we still haven't, gotten the decision can you talk a, little bit about um whether there might, be a strategy in all of this and you, know it seems almost certain that this, isn't going to happen in March and with, every day that goes by it seems like, it's not going to happen in April, either I think we're looking at late, spring maybe even early summer what, spring to you is that like when the, clocks go forward or when we're wearing, shorts in New York I I think it's when, at that point hopefully this will have, been before The Supreme Court and we'll, get the Supreme Court decision so that, later in the spring we are having this, trial um that that is my hope I I think, look I didn't think it would be so quick, I thought really we would be getting a, decision from the DC court of appeals, sometime this month tomorrow is the end, of the month so we are getting close to, this point where you are hoping that, they're going to come out with a, decision soon uh they it look it's a, decision they know is going to be, scrutinized a decision in a matter of, first impression and they want to get it, right and you probably are looking at, three judges who are trying to figure, out how to be unanimous so hopefully the, big thing I think is not necessarily, what the ruling will be I do think that, that part is easy maybe the reasoning is, different about how they get there but, ultimately the decision will be at the, end are they going to make sure that the, normal rules about 45 days to go andbon, before the entire court of appeals and, 90 days to go before The Supreme Court, are they going to stay those in their, decision are they going to Short Circuit, this so that they'll say our decision is, on hold you have X amount of time a week, two weeks to be able to petition to the, Supreme Court or petition for a full uh, court of appeals if they do that and I, expect and H that they will do that then, we should be back on track for this, thing to be in a trial mode by the late, spring very lawyerly that you're not, answering my question about spring is is, that spring forward or shorts of New, York I'll give it to you tonight, Christie but as time goes on my patience, will be tested um Devin Barrett from The, Washington Post Christy Greenberg thank, you for your time tonight, guys","shortTranscript":"one of the things the court is looking, at is what is the likelihood of a future, violation of this company and to whether, or not

far-right election denying um former, president of Brazil Jer bolsonaro, stormed the Brazilian Congress and, Supreme Court and presidential offices, they rioted they violently tried to, overturn the results of the election in, which their hero president Jer bolsonaro, had been voted out of office that was, one year ago today and here today is New, York Times Brazil bureau chief Jack, Nikas um writing about that parallel, experience he said quote there were two, shocking attacks on the western, hemisphere's two largest democracies, both broadcast around the world and both, prompted by presidents who had, questioned their legitimate election, losses each posed an extraordinary test, of the country's democracy and each, raised the question of how a deeply, polarized society would move forward in, the wake of such an assault with time, the answer to that question is become, becoming clear the parallel attacks have, had nearly opposite aftermaths in the, United States support is saring for, Donald J Trump's campaign to retake the, White House as he frames his 2020, election loss as the real Insurrection, and January 6th as a quote beautiful day, at the same time his counterpart in, Brazil the far-right former president, Jer bolsonaro has quickly faded into, Political irrelevance 6 months after he, left office last year electoral, officials barred him from running again, until, 2030 and many right-wing leaders have, shunned him why have there been such, contrasting reactions to such similar, threats researchers and analysts point, to a multitude of reasons including the, country's differing political systems, media Landscapes National histories and, judicial responses but one difference, especially stands out Steven levitzky a, Harvard professor of government, co-author of the book how democracies, die who has studied both the American, and Brazil Ian democracies says that, leaders on Brazil's right quote publicly, clearly unambiguously accepted the, results of the election and did exactly, what democratic politicians are supposed, to do he says quote that is strikingly, different from how Republicans responded, in the United, States Jer bolsonaro and Trump both, stoked their supporters into a violent, effort to seize power by force after, losing an election bolsonaro has since, become totally Irrelevant in politics in, Brazil while Trump is still at the head, of the Republican Party in the United, States and is poised to become the, party's nominee for president, again now part of that is yes that a, Brazilian Court ruled that bolsonaro, cannot run for office again until 2030, he is disqualified from politics for the, time being because of what he, did for Trump in this country it's an, open question as to whether he might, face the same kind of, disqualification the super conservative, US Supreme Court if will take up that, question just one month from today on, February 8th so it's it's it's partly a, matter of whether or not there's a, Judicial penalty for effectively Waging, War against your own country's, democracy but it's also a matter of how, Republicans how the party how American, Republican leaders have reacted to this, violence from their own leader how they, have reacted to this anti-democratic, turn in the leadership of their party it, is not just a trump, problem it's that Republicans like what, Trump did and they don't mind the idea, of him doing it, again Republican members of Congress and, US senators still voted to throw out the, results of the 2020 election the night, after the violent attack on Congress in, January, 2021 even today polls in Iowa ahead of, next week's caucuses show that that, Trump's pledge to root out his enemies, like Vermin claims like that make Iowa, Republican voters more likely to vote, for him not less when Trump was, criticized for saying that immigrants, are poisoning the blood of America when, he was criticized for that because, that's literally what Adolf Hitler said, about non-aryans in minec that claim, from Trump pulled so well among, Republicans and was so well received, among Republican voters that he not only, has kept using that same language over, and over again he's now sort of, institutionalizing it today the new, anti- Niki Haley ad that the trump super, Pac put up is an anti-immigrant ad that, is titled, poisoning to remind people that Trump, has adopted that Hitler, phraseology Republicans like this stuff, in Brazil the right did not like this, stuff and they rejected Jer bolsonaro's, efforts to stay in power by force and, that now means that bolsonaro is exiled, and, irrelevant but where did bolsonaro exile, to where did he go when he fled Brazil, fearing, prosecution he fled to Florida to Ronda, santisis Florida where as if the point, wasn't clear enough prot Trump, Republican groups have greeted him like, a, hero ladies and gentlemen get on your, feet and join me in welcoming president, boso, volaro greeted with a Heroes welcome at, the prot Trump Turning Point, USA Florida event in, Orlando he loves them they love, him bsar rejected in his own country, rejected by the rightwing in his own, country for his effort to violently, overthrow the second largest democracy, in the Western Hemisphere he is, celebrated by the Republican right-wing, in this country rejected in his own, country celebrated by our, right-wingers where the effort to, violently overthrow the largest, democracy in the Western Hemisphere us, has just been taking a three-year, breather and they're going to put up the, guy who tried it again it is not a trump, problem it's a Republican party problem, this is what they want other right wiers, who have charismatic leaders like Trump, around the world don't necessarily get, behind them when they try violence to, stay in power our Republicans, do and so this is how we get to the, first two speeches of the President Joe, Biden reelection effort in 2024 Friday, at Valley Forge in Pennsylvania and, today at the mother Emanuel am Church in, Charleston South Carolina the two, kickoff speeches of his 2024 reelection, campaign speeches about our status as a, democracy the fight to establish, ourselves as a democracy in the, Revolutionary War the fight to keep our, democracy in the Civil War the threat to, end democracy today posed by the, Republican party and, Trump and I don't know I don't have, Insider information but I doubt this is, the ground on which the Biden campaign, hope to be making its case for, re-election they have other things they, want to talk about like Nancy Pelosi was, just describing with Jens saki in her, exclusive interview tonight they want to, talk about kitchen table issues right, and they have a lot to talk about the, unemploy rate has been below 4% below 4%, for nearly two straight years that means, this is the best jobs Market in America, since the, 1960s jobs numbers under President Joe, Biden are better than every single year, of job numbers under President Donald, Trump including the years that Trump, says were the best economic years ever, actually no Joe bidens are better the, uninsured rate is the lowest in American, history for the last full quarter we, have numbers for the annual economic, growth rate in this country was, 5.2% which is an impossibly high, number remember when all the economists, said there was going to be a recession, in 2023 how about 5.2% annual growth, rate instead prices are coming down, including gas prices wages are going up, under Joe Biden the United States is, doing better than every single other, major economy in the world since, covid fighting against Republicans every, step of the way Joe Biden has zeroed out, or reduced student loan monthly payments, for tens of millions of Americans with, crushing student loan, debt I mean you talk about a contrast, with the Republican Party Joe Biden has, reduced or zeroed out student loan, payments for tens of millions and of, Americans and has fought to do it for, more what's the Republican idea that Joe, Biden would love to be running against, on that subject well hit it Governor D, santis let's hear from you the reality, is we've had a generation of students go, deep into debt and some of them end up, with degrees in things like zombie, studies which are just not making a, difference a lot of these degrees have, not given people a pathway to success, and it's caused them to be deep in debt, so what are you going to do about that, student loans should be dischargeable in, bankruptcy first of all y all majored in, ter things and so you deserve it but, also you know okay if you've got, terrible debt behold the Republican plan, for student debt declare bankruptcy you, guys hey students declare, bankruptcy that will set you up for, success that's how Republicans think you, should deal with High student debt, you're not going to get any help from us, just declare yourself bankrupt, personally the Biden campaign I'm sure, would love to be running on, that in Iowa this week ahead of the, caucuses one week week from today the, Trump campaign has scheduled an event, with Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee, Sanders what is Sarah Huckabee Sanders, famous for since she stopped being the, Trump White House spokesperson well as, Governor she has distinguished herself, by repealing child labor laws okay, because who Among Us doesn't think there, isn't anything wrong with America that, can't be fixed by chaining a few more, children to the Looms like we used to do, in the good old, days the Biden campaign I'm sure would, love to be running on issues like that, on the issue of abortion, rights as of tonight we are seeing the, first news reporting from The New Yorker, about the first American woman who may, have died in Texas because of the, Republicans abortion ban there her name, was Yenni Glick she was married it was a, high-risk, pregnancy four outside experts who, reviewed her medical file after her, death have all concluded that when the, life-threatening complications started, in her high-risk pregnancy had she been, offered an abortion it quote probably, would have saved her life she, died the United States Supreme Court, dominated by Republican appointees has, just allowed Republican controlled Idaho, state government to reinstate its new, abortion ban which threatens doctors, with 5 years in prison if they perform, an abortion in the case of a medical, emergency threatening the health of a, woman they are letting that go into, effect in Idaho while the court, considers Idaho overall Idaho's overall, abortion ban the court is not going to, consider that Idaho abortion ban though, until, April and the law will be in effect, until then so Idaho doctors will have at, least a few months now when they will, have to decide between prison five years, in prison and trying to save patients, literally in the emergency, room the Biden campaign I'm sure would, appreciate running on heart- rening, issues like, that, but instead they are having to run on, heart-rending issues like, this eventually it culminated that the, the long break summering break between, he and myself in June of 2020 when he, wanted to deploy active duty troops on, the street of Washington DC and and, suggested actually that we we shoot, American um Americans in the, streets when he suggested that we shoot, Americans in the, streets Trump's Former Defense secretary, Mark esper the differences between the, Democratic party and the Republican, Party are Myriad and important in a, two-party system each party by, definition is really important even when, the party is occasionally a hot, mess but once one of those two parties, is knowingly picking the shoot Americans, in the street, option the violent overthrow of the, government option the dictatorship on, day one, option it does get hard to talk about, any anything, else and so here we go Iowa is a week, from tonight the Republican cause of, their front running candidate has, already seen 1,200 people criminally, charged over 800 convicted or pled, guilty and their candidate himself, facing 91 felonies his Republican, primary opponents both Nikki Haley and, Ronda santis say they will pardon him if, they are elected and this by definition, will have to be the grounds on which the, entire contest is fought this year not, because of one man but because this is, one whole party that has picked this as, their, cause so here we, go 2024 be there will be, wild the latest wave started on, Christmas Day police and ambulances came, screaming up to the home of the mayor of, Boston Michelle woo they were responding, to a 911 call about a shooting inside, her home there had been no shooting, inside her home the call was uh poke it, was designed to provoke a scary and, potentially dangerous police response, that same day Christmas Day, congresswoman margerie Taylor green of, Georgia also reported being the victim, of a similar hoax 911 call a couple days, later it was Florida US senator Rick, Scott who had police called to his house, for again a non-existent reported, shooting that same day the same thing, happened at the home of Georgia's, Republican lieutenant governor for good, measure a bomb threat was called into, his office the next morning two days, later it was the secretary of state of, Maine that call Drew emergency, responders to her home just just a day, after she announced she was barring, Donald Trump from the state's ballot, because of his role in the attack on, Congress on January 6 2021 the following, day December 30th it was police swarming, the home of California's lieutenant, governor after a false report of a, shooting at that home that call came, after California's lieutenant governor, also called for Trump to be barred from, California's ballot then last night at, about 10:00, police and fire vehicles descended on, the Washington home of the federal judge, who is overseeing Trump's January 6 case, in DC once again a fake report of a, shooting had been called in nothing was, a Miss at the judge's home but it, provoked a massive and dangerous police, response it's called swatting it's, calling in fake emergencies to draw an, armed police response hopefully a SWAT, team response to somebody's home armed, police rushing into what they believe is, a very dangerous active shooter, situation it's always scary it's always, risky it's something that has had fatal, consequences in the past and we right, now are in the midst of a spree of, swatting calls to state and federal, officials including, judges and in fact on that score we have, some breaking news uh for you tonight, NBC News is now reporting that it is not, just the federal judge in Trump's, Federal January 6 case who has been, attacked like this in recent days it is, also special councel Jack Smith we can, now report Jack Smith was also the, victim of an attempted swatting at his, Washington area home on Christmas day, two law enforcement officials telling, excuse me two law enforcement sources, telling NBC news that someone called 911, that day reporting that Jack Smith had, shot his wife at the address where Smith, lives local police did dispatch units, toward the home they were called off, when Deputy US Marshals protecting Smith, and his family told police it was a, false alarm, no arrests have been made a spokesperson, for the special council's office is, declining to, comment President Biden um I think I, don't know but I think um not, necessarily by his own choice but by, necessity is focusing his campaign on, threats to democracy uh you very, famously have made that case to the, American public yourself in your role in, impeachment in the January 6, investigation what do you make of this, as a strategic call by the president I, think it's born of necessity we are at a, really fragile point in the history of, our country and the history of our, democracy uh you talked in your opening, discussion about the state of our, two-party system in a two-party, system both parties need to have uh, relative Health they need to be healthy, for the system to work um I I I look, forward to the day when the Republican, party is once again a home for people, like Liz Cheney and Adam kinzinger but, today the Republican party is in, terribly ill health uh and judged by, that standard our democracy is more, vulnerable today than it was three years, ago three years ago we would be now two, days from January 6th and two days after, those events Republican leaders were, repudiating Donald Trump Uh Kevin, McCarthy was talking about his, culpability and you had Mitch McConnell, around that time talking about there, being remedies IE prosecution for, someone who engages in this kind of, thing um here we are 3 years later the, Republican party is trying to completely, reinvent those days and what what took, place they have embraced him closer than, ever he is worse than ever uh they're, describing both the president and and, Republican leaders like stefanic those, who were arrested on that day as, hostages as political prisoners well two, days after the actual event they were, not describing those who beat off, officers and gouged them and bears, sprayed them and had members of Congress, running for their lives they weren't, describing them as you know political, prisoners those who were arrested uh in, that melee but now they are um in terms, of its commitment to democracy the, Republican party is way worse than it, was on that day uh and it's been a a, clear trajectory um I often look to the, canaries in the coal mine and one of, them for me was in 2016 not When Donald, Trump was elected Al that was a pretty, compelling sign we were in trouble but, in North Carolina on the same day when a, Democratic governor was elected and, Republicans in North Carolina responded, not by saying next time we're going to, do better not by saying we'll have, better message or better policies or, better candidate but by instead, stripping the Democratic governor of his, responsibilities is what the Republicans, in the legislature did that was an ethic, that said it's no longer about democracy, it's no longer about free and fair, elections it's about if you lose you try, to change the rules of the game or as we, would see four years later you try to, overturn the result Or democrats are, inherently um ineligible to hold power, and only Republicans can hold power I, mean that to me was the lesson out of, North Carolina that your enemy your, political enemy is not somebody who you, try to beat in an election and whoever, wins gets power your political enemy is, not allowed to ever hold power even if, they win and that's the end, yes yes uh if the other side wins it is, inherently illegitimate, yeah","shortTranscript":"the unemployment rate has been below 4%, below 4% for nearly two

SOLDIERS, BEING BEHEADED AFTER THEY WERE, KILLED BY THE HAMAS MILITANTS., AND HE CONTINUES THESE, COMPARISONS TO THE HOLOCAUST., WE GOT A GLIMPSE OF SOME OF WHAT, THE PRIME MINISTER WAS TALKING, ABOUT EARLIER TODAY., THE ISRAELI MILITARY TOOK US TO, A KIBBUTZ., IT IS ABOUT A HALF MILE FROM THE, GAZA BORDER., IT IS ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES, OVERRUN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF, SATURDAY MORNING., WE SAW THE BREACH IN THE FENCE, FROM WHICH THESE HAMAS, TERRORISTS PARDON., AND WE SAW NEARLY UNBELIEVABLE, SCENES IN WHAT AT ANOTHER TIME, WOULD BE SORT OF PLEASANT RURAL, VILLAGE., WE WENT HOUSE BY HOUSE AND WE, SAW BLOOD EVERYWHERE., WE SAW SOME HOUSES HAD BEEN, BURNED OUT COMPLETELY WITH THEIR, INHABITANTS INSIDE., THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT WAS 700, PEOPLE., BUT IT FELT LIKE EVERY COUPLE, MINUTES, WHEN WE WERE THERE, TODAY, EVEN FOUR DAYS AFTER THE, ATTACK, ISRAELI FORCES SEEM TO, BE FINDING NEW BODIES INSIDE OF, THESE HOUSES., IT IS VERY POSSIBLE OF THIS, COMMUNITY OF 700 PEOPLE, A VERY,, VERY SIGNIFICANT PORTION HAVE, LOST THEIR LIVES., OTHERS MAY BE HELD HOSTAGE, INSIDE OF GAZA., ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING SCENES, WE WALKED PAST THE VILLAGE, KINDERGARTEN WHICH SOMEHOW HAD, BEEN SPARED., THE GUNFIRE, WASN'T FULL OF, BULLET HOLES WE SAW ON OTHER, BUILDINGS., BUT WHEN YOU TURNED AND YOU WERE, FACING THE LAWN OF THIS, KINDERGARTEN, THERE WERE BODIES, OF THESE HAMAS FIGHTERS ROTTING, IN THE SUN., LYING THERE WITH RIGOR MORTIS., JUST AN UNSPEAKABLE SCENE., THE SENSE WE HAVE FROM THE, ISRAELI MILITARY, FROM THE, REPORTING WE'VE DONE, FROM, IMAGES COMING OUT, THAT SCENE, HAS BEEN PLAYED OVER AND OVER, AGAIN AT THESE DIFFERENT, KIBBUTZIM., AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL WHERE IT, APPEARS 260 PEOPLE HAVE DIED., SO IF PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS, BRIEFED ON EVEN A FRACTION OF, WHAT WE SAW TODAY, YOU GET A, SENSE WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE, UNITED STATES WAS SO EMOTIONAL, WHEN HE SPOKE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, EARLIER., >> AND RAF, IT IS REMARKABLE, THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT, IT SO CALMLY, GIVEN WHAT YOU SAW, TODAY., I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE TAKEN","shortTranscript":"the Israeli military took us to a kibutz, it's called kafar Aza it's about half a, mile from the Gaza border it is one of, those communities that was overrun we, went house by house and we saw blood, everywhere we saw some houses had been, burned out completely with their, inhabitants inside Israeli forces seem, to be finding new bodies inside of these, houses it is very possible of this, community of 700 people a very very, significant proportion have lost their, lives if the President Biden was briefed, on even a

hush money, criminal trial kicks off its fifth week, this morning with one of the most, anticipated Witnesses of the entire, trial expect to take the stand today, Michael Cohen the former attorney and, fixer for Trump is set to testify about, his role in negotiating the hush money, payment to adult film actress stormmy, Daniels on Trump's behalf during the, 2016 presidential campaign to keep her, quiet about an alleged sexual encounter, with Trump Cohen continue contends the, reimbursements to him were falsified at, Trump's Direction which is Central to, the prosecution's case but the defense, will undoubtedly hammer away at Cohen's, credibility in 2018 he pleaded guilty to, Federal campaign Finance violations and, other charges and was sentenced to three, years in prison but even before taking, the stand Cohen was a key point of, discussion on Friday when judge Juan, musan told prosecutors to ask Cohen to, stop commenting publicly about the, former president or the hush money trial, itself Trump's lawyers argued that it, was not fair for their client to be, under a gag order and not be able to, talk about Cohen while Cohen was free to, talk about Trump additionally prosecutor, said they have two witnesses left to, call and may be able to rest their case, by the end of this week the defense May, then call its own Witnesses let's bring, in former litigator and MSNBC legal, correspondent Lisa Rubin also with us, the president of the National Action, Network and host of msnbc's Politics, Nation Reverend Al Sharpton Lisa I'll, start with you with what you're looking, for today what can we expect today so, before the trial started I said that I, expected Michael Cohen sort of to be, like the narrator of the or the tour, guide here that he's the one person, other than Alan weberg who won't be, testifying who might have had a view of, the entire, narrative here from start to finish from, that August 2015 meeting where David, pecker Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, devised the conspiracy for how they were, going to use American Media and, specifically the national inquir to, ensure Donald Trump had his best chance, at election all the way through the end, of 2017 when the repayment scheme was, finished but I was wrong about that, instead of being the narrator think, about Cohen today as sort of the sum up, guy and specifically the guy who's going, to fill the gaps that can't be filled by, other witnesses there are several, episodes here that are uniquely within, Michael Cohen's knowledge and for which, there is no substitute specifically, conversations that he had with Trump in, which Trump may have as he put it when, he pled guilty in August 2018 directed, him specifically to ensure that the, payments to Karen McDougall and Stormy, Daniels were made and then after the, election any conversations that they had, that would tie Trump directly to that, repayment scheme that prosecutors alleg, constituted 34 counts of falsification, of business records we've seen evidence, to date that those payments were in fact, disguised as payments for legal services, that were never rendered pursuant to a, retainer agreement that seemingly didn't, exist but what we haven't seen so far is, any direct evidence that Donald Trump, himself directed at at best we've seen a, piece of paper showing that Alan, weiselberg his trusted Deputy in the, former CFO sort of sketched out exactly, how this repayment scheme was going to, work we also know that Donald Trump, himself signed nine checks attached to, which there was paperwork saying they, were for legal services and they were, for a retainer by each month count on, Michael Cohen then today to start, filling those gaps in the already, substantial evidentiary record but their, gaps only Michael Cohen can fill and a, as Michael K fills these gaps uh because, he's the one now that the prosecution, has laid out uh the case the checks the, uh weiselberg uh correcting or or, etching some stuff out and putting in, what they want all of these things like, breadcrumbs leading somewhere Cohen is, the one that can say exactly what, happened exactly what the conversation, was and he went to jail in part for this, he's already done time here so for the, prosecution uh has laid that out but for, the defense to say that uh Michael K is, not a credible witness well he's, conceding that I went to jail for, exactly what Donald Trump and I did uh, for those reasons and doesn't it least, put uh the defense in a peculiar, position that if K testifies to this and, lo it keeps this cool and does this, under Fire the only evidence they can, bring in to counter him would be to put, Donald Trump on the stand if Donald, Trump and Michael kohin had these, conversations confidentially how do they, contradict it in defense I don't think, that they're going to contradict it, directly rev what they're going to do is, just completely pick apart Michael, Cohen's credibility and unfortunately, Michael Cohen has given them some, ammunition to do so when Michael Cohen, pled guilty to a series of federal, crimes one of the things that he pled, guilty to was tax evasion that really, wasn't connected to his misdeeds for, Donald Trump he has subsequently said, publicly many times I actually didn't, commit those crimes I said that I did in, front of a federal judge under oath to, spare my family that may be intelligible, to people but that still constitutes a, lie under oath and they are going to use, that to their advantage to pick Michael, Cohen apart and say if you were lying, them when you plad guilty to these other, crimes how do we know that you're not, lying now and that you didn't lie also, about the campaign Finance scheme in, order to save your own, hide back in February of 2019 Michael, Cohen testified on Capital Hill where he, said he was ashamed he took part in, quote concealing Mr Trump's illicit acts, rather than listening to my own, conscience he also went toe-to-toe with, Republicans including GOP congressman, Jim Jordan of Ohio for what Cohen said, was a, mischaracterization of his guilty plea, back in 2018 to Federal campaign Finance, violations and other charges take a, listen we just had a a a 5minute debate, where Mr Cohen disputes what the, southern district of New York found what, the judge found that he was actually, guilty of committing bank fraud if if, this statement back here doesn't say at, all Cohen's consciousness of wrongdoing, is fleeting his remorse is minimal his, instinct is to blame others is to blame, others is strong there's only thing one, wrong with that statement his remorse is, non-existent he just debated a member of, Congress saying I really didn't do, anything wrong with the false bank, things that that I'm guilty of and gone, to prison for Mr Jord that's not that's, not what I said and you know that that's, not what I said said I pled guilty and I, take responsibility for my, actions shame on you Mr Jordan Mr said, Mr Mr chairman not what I said what I, said is I took responsibility and I take, responsibility what I was doing is, explaining to the gentleman that his, facts are inaccurate I still I take, responsibility for my mistakes all right, I am remorseful and I am going to prison, I will be away from my wife and family, for years so before you turn around and, you cast more dision, understand there are people watching you, today that know me a whole lot but I, made mistakes I own, them so over his shoulder you see that, gentleman right there

Michael Cohen who will, take the stand today well I talked to, Michael last night almost every night, and good to see Joe Scarboro it was back, in 1998 that we uh worked a little bit, in the hallways of CNN uh around the, problems that President Clinton faced, and he ultimately had to go public and, express remorse and Michael and I talked, last night and we recalled the journey, that we've been on M in late June of, 2018 before he went public I asked him, how is anyone going to believe you after, 10 years of lying for Donald Trump and, he said to me then and he repeated in, front of a national and international, audience live under oath I'm ashamed of, what I did I have remorse for what I did, and I will take the consequences and go, to prison for what I did so you're are, going to hear that during today's uh and, this week's testimony that Michael con, uh owns what he did wrong and apologized, and took the punishment by going to, prison but you're also going to see, everything everything that Michael con, testifies to after spending years with, these prosecutors behind closed doors, Michael and me everything will be, corroborated by text messages by, documents even by Witnesses loyal to, president Trump that's why I believe, this jury despite the attacks and, personal attacks on Michael will believe, Michael come so so that's what I was, going to ask you is that obviously um he, can make that a very emotional uh, display of of being accountable and even, paying for his crimes but the defense, will undermine his cred credibility as, best they can because he has openly lied, um so you're saying that there won't be, anything that he says in court that, isn't backed up by some sort of, receipt that's correct but let me, complet compl the sentence he lied okay, on behalf of and for the benefit of, Donald Trump and he owned those lies he, doesn't defend those lies but he have to, finish the sentence I would also remind, Lisa Rubin who I greatly respect that a, great criminal defense lawyer has said, who's defending Michael and former, member of the southern district of New, York that when he was in court on the, tax crimes he was talking about the, disproportionate, criminalization of for being forced to, plead guilty she said because on a, Friday night for the first time he he, was threatened with an indictment of his, wife unless he plad guilty and an, indictment the following Monday so she, said that was a coerced situation but he, doesn't excuse himself he went to prison, for those crimes and he served his time, but he'll turn to the jury and he will, say I own those and now I'm telling you, the truth and they're backed up by, documents and by other and it'll be up, to the jury to decide The credibility, personal attacks by uh Mr Trump's, lawyers were attempted in the trial, before the Attorney General vicious, cross-examination and what did the judge, end up concluding he found Michael Cohen, credible I think that will be the case, for this jury Lenny I have a question, for you which is at that last trial that, you were just talking about when Michael, Cohen testified at the Civil fraud trial, one of the ways that Trump's people, exploited what they thought were, inconsistencies in his testimony was to, call attention to the word directed they, said that Michael Cohen first testified, that Trump asked him to do things and, then in the second day he clarified that, he was never personally directed to do, something that strikes me as a situation, where wording really matters here how do, you think Michael Cohen is going to deal, with that today he's already said at his, plea allocution that President Trump, directed him to be involved with the, Stormy Daniels and car McDougall, payments should we expect to hear the, same today yes Lisa but you'll also uh, remember that the federal prosecutors, working for Donald Trump's justice, department filed a public document on, December 7th 2018 people forget this the, southern district prosecutors said that, the hush money was paid under the, direction and, coordination of individual one which was, Donald Trump so I cite the same facts, with the ample FBI search supported, investigation where southern district of, New York prosecutors found as a fact on, the same facts that Michael con was, directed and the coordination by Donald, Trump now whether this jury reaches the, same conclusion as the federal, prosecutors working for Donald Trump's, justice department is up to the jury to, decide but don't forget that document, Lisa you should read, it axius has compiled a list of, responses from elected Republicans when, asked if they would accept the results, of November's elections their answers, are far from reassuring it all starts, with Donald Trump who has not committed, to accepting the results of the 2024, race Senator J D van told CNN State of, the Union yesterday that he'll accept, the results if they're quote fair and, free in February he told ABC news that, if he were Vice President in 2020 he, would have told states to submit, alternate slates of electors and let, Congress decide Senator Tim Scott dodged, eight times when Meet the Press host, Kristen Welker asked if he' accept the, next election's results calling it a, hypothetical question congresswoman at, least to pic said she'll accept results, if, constitutional but also said the 2020, election was not because of covid era, changes to voting Senator Lindsey Graham, told Meet the Press on Sunday that he'll, accept the results if there is no, massive cheating and Congressman Byron, Donalds will accept the results if he, thinks they're fair and if States follow, their own laws Joe um um I just I I, don't well I'm I'm going to send this, right to you uh what do we do with this, I mean what do how are voters supposed, to process this, information well you've got one party, that says they'll accept the results of, the election if they like the results of, the election they say things that are, all very subjective if they think it's, fair and we can go back to 2020 to see, where you had members of the Trump, Administration who were responsible, protecting voting in 2020 saying it was, the safest election the cleanest, election in American, history and into that with that, background you've had Republicans who, have refused to accept the results uh so, so it is it's all subjective if they, like the, results they'll accept the results if, they don't like the results they won't, accept the results let bringing Donnie, dut he's the host of the podcast on, brand with Donnie dut and it's great, podcast by the way Donnie you're also of, course uh you know an ad Legend a, advertising Legend a branding Legend now, let's talk about the Republican brand, here, uh you know you don't no need to engage, in, hyperbole um the peaceful transition of, power uh has been the, guarantor of American democracy of West, democracy for, centuries uh where the loser accepts the, results and we've seen you know In Our, Lifetime we saw Al gour do it in the, most extraordinary way the most dramatic, way uh it's it's putting country over, party and so you, know here we have a vote we're going to, have a vote this fall and uh I know a, lot of uh Republicans uh John me would, call Peter malar vest wearing, Republicans uh who just want to pretend, that it's Bob Dole against Bill Clinton, uh they're going well I you know I just, always vote for a republican no that, this year this year you're not just, voting for a republican it's a vote for, a candidate who doesn't, believe and in the most basic principles, of American democracy and we could get, on the list but I really don't want to, waste my breath on it because everybody, knows about it everybody knows about you, know the killing of generals and etc etc, etc but you have Republicans uh those, Peter malar vest wearing Republicans who, want to say oh it's just like you know, it's Republicans and Democrats what's, the difference no it's a vote actually, for somebody that does not subscribe to, the most basic precepts of American, democracy against a candidate who does, and and it's it's really that simple, Donnie isn't it it is you know we we've, said many times on the show when an, authoritarian tells you what they're, going to do you pay attention to him, well now his followers are telling you, what they're going to do so you pay, attention to it and for anybody in Jo, you can take off the list we can all, take off the list whether it's no longer, a free election whether it's a, weaponized uh justice department whether, it's a un independent Federal, Communications Commission on and on and, on we can, go when anybody says to to me well, that's not really going to happen, because we've got checks and balances in, the institutions and you're already seen, there will be no checks and balances so, not only do we have the tell from, fearless leader we have the tell from, the leming followers so there's no, mystery here so there is absolutely no, mystery here so anybody that votes, Republican and doesn't understand you're, voting for the end of democracy just pay, attention to the Sunday shows this past, weekend and the other thing I want to, say we've talked a lot about this on the, show and I've talked about this as a man, these pathetic men the spinelessness the, the the the obsequiousness the the the, the sucking upness I don't know how they, face their loved ones I don't know how, they go to their children these are the, guy these are the guys that talk about, the war on masculinity right they play, tough guys and as I've always said about, the war on masculinity like if if you're, a real man you don't really notice that, people are trying to declare a war on, masculinity you just go out and you do, what you're supposed to do and and you, you tune out the noise and yet these, guys that play tough guys and and and, and want you know like want want the, world to be more manly and they're Tak, they're the least masculine men they are, they are the guys that went to Ivy, League colleges and won't defend their, father's honor they won't defend their, wies honor they will allow Donald Trump, to say the worst most humiliating things, about them constantly, uh uh um how do I say it, politely just obiously don't use the, word don't use the word Joe don't do it, I used it once I got a lot of trouble, don't do it yeah they they they they, just well I I I can't say it, they they just he undermines them and he, humiliates them and and they just come, back for more and they're the ones, writing books about, manhood give me, a freaking break it is yeah it I I just, can't understand I don't know if these, guys had their lunch money taken growing, up I don't know what it is I keep, thinking about Josh Holly prancing, across uh the the the the capital during, during during The Siege there but these, are you know the irony and you bring it, up about them talking about the the male, Under Siege in this country um you guys, are not setting an example for what it, look means to stand up and be a man no, they're, not I think when the women and the men, really take to heart what they've heard, today that out those 16,000 deaths 10, were preventable that they will perhaps, turn to an old book that they may not, have read carefully but still has the, circulation of any book in the world it, is called the Bible and they were, searched in the cets and they were found, the text give the Garment of Praise for, the spirit of Heaven wow that was former, First Lady Edith Roosevelt the wife of, the 26th president of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt speaking about women's, health issues in her first ever talki, recorded back in 193 1 joining us now, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt, Presidential Library Foundation Edward, O'Keefe he's the author of the new book, entitled the loves of theater Roosevelt, the women who created a president and, thank you for being on um, congratulations on this book that was, incredible just to watch that video so, who are the women who created the, president Beyond EDI M it's just, wonderful to be with you thank you uh, the the the loves of theore Ros El makes, the argument that Theodore Roosevelt, perhaps the most masculine president in, the American memory was actually the, product of women his two sisters his two, wives and his mother of, course this book is amazing to me, because I love a good unsung women in, history story and when you think of TR, you really think of him you know just, out on the frontier so masculine and can, you tell us the story of what led him to, North Dakota because it really is such a, moving and emotional drama that he went, through oh at least it's it's, unbelievable it's a February 14th 1884, Theodore Roosevelt rushes back from the, New York State Assembly because he has, heard that his wife Alice who has just, given birth to their first child is not, well he arrives through this dick this, extremely thick dance fog and you know, so thick that the New York Times says, it's suicidal weather you can't see 2 in, before your face and he arrives at his, home at 6 West 57 Street and his brother, has said there is a curse on this house, mother is dying and Alice is dying too, he runs up to the third floor he holds, Alice until 2:30 in the morning when, he's summoned down to the second floor, his wife midi who's the source of his, ulent personality and she succumbs to, typhoid fever at 2:30 in the morning he, runs back up to the third floor holds, his wife Alice in his arms for 11 hours, until she too dies at 2:30 in the, afternoon both his mother and his wife, die on Valentine's Day that's what, brings him out to the bad lands of North, Dakota where he recovers in nature and, feels uh the power of the Badland 65, million years of geologic history, unfolding like a textbook in front of, him and and so little is known about, Alice I mean she was uh she was kind of, like Audrey heurn or Kate heurn she's, athletic and vivacious she's you know uh, she's the most eligible Bachelorette in, Boston when Theodore Roosevelt this odd, taxidermist meets her and pursues her, for the better part of two years really, Alice uh changed the trajectory of, Theodore Roosevelt's life and as a, result the nation so Edward tell us, about uh how this book came about and, the discovery of these letters that, really form the backbone of of of this, remarkable book well thank you Jonathan, I mean but we came across 11 new letters, that had been locked in a safe since, 1954 Greg win the president of the theer, Roosevelt Association opened that safe, and these letters reveal a part of, Theodore Roosevelt's life that has never, been reported in any other book the, loves of Theodore Roosevelt has these, details for the for the first time we, also have the advantage of 24 love, letters between Alice and theer these, gorgeous these you know theer Roosevelt, the rugged environmentalist known for, Mount Rushmore in these Feats of, physical strength well here he's saying, to his wife there is nothing whatever, else but you the Romantic side of this, extraordinary president revealed for the, first time those letters 24 of them in, the loves of theer Roosevelt and not, available to Prior uh books truly a, remarkable Discovery Willie to find a, piece of History like that for to help, to to to find a figure who we all, thought we knew so, well yeah Ed I didn't know you were a, safe cracker on top of everything else, getting into that safe at Sagamore Hill, out an Oyster Bay congratulations on, this book it is really so fascinating I, think one of the big themes people may, take away from it is this the mythology, around Teddy Roosevelt as this self-made, man this rugged self-made man he may, have been rugged but he wasn't, necessarily self-made like so many, prominent men he had an awful lot of, help from the women around him well, Willie that's exactly it right I the, that's the story I was told about, Theodore Roosevelt growing up is this, myth of the self-made man and you know, we all of us have if we're fortunate in, our lives brothers sisters mothers, a husband or a wife a colleague a friend, somebody who picks us up when we're down, and propels US forward right it's, Mother's Day on Sunday and I think we, can stop and appreciate that theore, Roosevelt's mother was this, extraordinary source of strength in his, life as mothers often are you know it, doesn't diminish the legacy of Theodore, Roosevelt to understand that he needed, help and I think that you know these all, of these women his his mother his two, wives his sisters you know bamy bamy his, sister is just an extraordinary figure, right she Elanor Roosevelt says of bamy, that had bamy been a man she not, Theodore Roosevelt would have been, president of the United States Franklin, delanor Roosevelt says of Edith his, second wife that she managed TR quite, cleverly without his being conscious of, it I mean you know this is these are, extraordinary women and they've really, been written off in history it is time, to take their stories out into public, view I think it's important that these, stories of women are told you know we, don't have the stories of Queens like, the UK the United Kingdom those stories, are powerful women in powerful positions, and they tell future gen Generations, this is possible for you too and and, that's why I think it's important to, tell the story We Tell in the loves of, theater, Rosevelt for","shortTranscript":"has anyone ever SE a Silence of the lips, the late great Hannibal Lector is a, wonderful man he often times would have, a friend for

KNOW IT'S STILL VERY EARLY IN, THIS PROCESS., BUT AT LEAST SOME FORMER, EMPLOYEES ARE ASKING THAT, QUESTION., WE KNOW THE NEED WAS SO GRAVE, AND SO MAJOR IN GAZA., BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SO WAS, THE

BODIES OF THEIR, COLLEAGUES OUT OF GAZA AND, GETTING THEM HOME., THE FOCUS WORLDWIDE IS ON THE, ISRAELI MILITARY., HOW IS IT THAT THE ISRAELIS, OPENED FIRE ON THIS CONVOY WHEN, WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN, COORDINATED THEIR MOVEMENTS, AHEAD OF TIME?, I THINK WHEN THE DUST SETTLES,, THERE WILL BE IMPORTANT, QUESTIONS FOR THIS AID, ORGANIZATION TO ASK ITSELF, ABOUT WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT, COULD HAVE BEEN DONE, DIFFERENTLY?, ONE QUESTION JUST FROM THE TOP, OF MIND, WAS THERE AN, ALTERNATIVE TO MOVING AROUND AT, NIGHT DURING IN THE MIDDLE OF A, WAR ZONE?, WE ARE SEEING THE UNITED, NATIONS TODAY SAYING IT IS, SUSPENDING NIGHT-TIME ACTIVITY, FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS WHILE IT, TRIES TO WORK OUT ITS SECURITY, PROTOCOLS., SO THAT IS ONE QUESTION., BUT WE SHOULD SAY, TOM, IT DOES, APPEAR WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN, DID JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THEY, POSSIBLY COULD TO SIGNAL TO THE, ISRAELIS THAT THIS WAS A, HUMANITARIAN CONVOY, AND IT WAS, NOT A THREAT., >> AND THEN RAF, I KNOW YOU, HAVE AN UPDATE., WE

OF THE STATE SPLITTING, ITS VOTE, IT WOULD BE WINNER, TAKE ALL LIKE MOST OTHER, STATES., IT DOES CREATE A POSSIBLE, SCENARIO IN WHICH ALL OF THOSE, VOTES WOULD GO TO FORMER, PRESIDENT TRUMP IN NOVEMBER., AND LOOK AT THIS., THERE IS A SCENARIO IF FORMER, PRESIDENT TRUMP WINS BACK SOME, OF THE STATES THAT ARE, AVAILABLE TO HIM AND TAKES THAT, NEBRASKA ELECTORAL VOTE THAT, WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE GONE TO, PRESIDENT BIDEN, WE COULD END, UP IN A 269-269 ELECTORAL VOTE, TIE SENDING THE ENTIRE RESULT, OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO, THE HOUSE., TOM, IT WOULD BE AN, EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT-FACE BASED,

THIS POPPING, UP RIGHT NOW?, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR IS HARDLY THE, OLDEST ON THE SUPREME COURT., CLARENCE THOMAS IS 75., JOHN ROBERTS IS ALSO 69., SO WHY THE FOCUS ON SOTOMAYOR?, >> Reporter: WELL, I THINK THE, LIST THAT YOU GAVE VERSUS, SOTOMAYOR TELLS US A LOT ABOUT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE, TWO GROUPS., IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT, THEIR AGE., IT'S ABOUT THEIR IDEOLOGY., WHILE LIBERAL ADVOCATES, THE, ONES PUSHING FOR SOTOMAYOR TO, CONSIDER RETIREMENT WOULD, PROBABLY LOVE TO SEE THOSE, THREE INDIVIDUALS STEP DOWN AS, WELL, THERE'S NO CHANCE THAT, THEY'RE GOING TO BOW TO A, PRESSURE CAMPAIGN., SOTOMAYOR IS THE ONE THAT HAS, THEM THE MOST CONCERNED BECAUSE, SHE IS THE OLDEST MEMBER OF THE, LIBERAL WING OF THIS SUPREME, COURT, AND THAT IS THE PORTION, OF THE SUPREME COURT THAT, THEY'RE MOST WORRIED ABOUT, BEING IN DANGER SHOULD, PRESIDENT BIDEN LOSE THE, ELECTION., >> RYAN, IF JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, WERE TO STEP DOWN AND WE HAVE, NO REASON TO BELIEVE SHE WOULD,, BUT WHEN COULD WE EXPECT TO,

REPLACEMENT FOR RUTH BADER, GINSBURG, THE RECORD AMOUNT OF, TIME THAT THE REPUBLICANS WERE, ABLE TO CONFIRM AMY CONEY, BARRETT TO HER POSITION ON THE, COURT., SO IT'S REALLY UP TO BOTH THE, SENATE AND THE WHITE HOUSE TO, MAKE THAT PROCESS MOVE QUICKLY., THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATS STILL, HAVE CONTROL OF THE SENATE, SHOULD ALLOW THAT PROCESS TO, MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY IF IT, COMES TO THAT, WHICH IS PART OF, NEWS SHOWS, TO THE TOP STORIES,, BREAKING NEWS, AND LIVE VIDEO,, DOWNLOAD THE NBC NEWS MOBILE, APP NOW., >>> ALL RIGHT, WE'RE BACK NOW, WITH MONEY TALKS., AND THE MOVE BY COSTCO TO ENTER, THE WEIGHT LOSS DRUG TREND., THAT'S RIGHT., THE WHOLESALE RETAILER THAT, MAKES YOU THINK OF BULK-SIZED, SNACKS, THOSE GIANT CROISSANTS, AND FREE FOOD SAMPLES WILL NOW, OVERPRESCRIPTIONS FOR GOP-1, WEIGHT DRUGS LIKE OZEMPIC AND, WEGOVY., IT STARTS AT $179 FOR A THREE-, MONTH SUBSCRIPTION., TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT, IT, WE'RE JOINED BY THE CO, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF, SESAME., THANK FOR JOINING TOP STORY, TONIGHT., WHEN PEOPLE SEE THIS STORY,, THEY SEE THE HEADLINES, THEY'LL, SEE $179., WHAT EXACTLY IS INCLUDED IN, THAT PRICE TAG?, >> SURE., THE $179 COMPONENT IS THE, CLINICAL COMPONENT., THE TIME YOU'RE SPENDING, ENGAGING WITH A CLINICIAN., SO THE DOCTOR THAT'S GOING TO, BE SEEING YOU, THAT WILL BE, DECIDING IF YOU'RE A GOOD, CANDIDATE FOR A PARTICULAR, MEDICATION, PRESCRIBING THAT, MEDICATION, MANAGING YOU ON IT., IT'S FOR THE LIVE VISITS WITH, THAT CLINICIAN AS WELL AS FOR, ONGOING COMMUNICATION WITH, THEM., SO MESSAGING THAT YOU CAN DO, WITH THAT CLINICIAN 24/7., >> TO BE CLEAR, YOU DON'T GET, THE MEDICINE., YOU DON'T GET OZEMPIC FOR $179, A MONTH., >> I WISH, YEAH., AT THIS POINT, THAT IS STILL, PRICING MEDICATION., AND THERE ARE OTHER MEDICATIONS, THAT ARE MORE AFFORDABLE IN THE, SPACE, AND I THINK WHEN AN, INDIVIDUAL PATIENT TALKS TO, THEIR DOCTOR, THEY CAN MAKE A, DECISION BETWEEN IF THE DRUG IS, COVERED OR NOT, WHAT'S THE, RIGHT OPTION FOR THEM, AND DO, THEY NEED A DRUG IN THE FIRST, PLACE?, SOME PEOPLE, THE DRUG MIGHT BE, COVERED, AND THEN IT'S A CO-, PAY., FOR OTHERS, THEY MIGHT DECIDE, TO CHOOSE A MORE AFFORDABLE, MEDICATION THAT'S AVAILABLE., >> WHY IS COSTCO AND YOUR, COMPANY SESAME GETTING INTO, PRESCRIBING WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS?, >> SURE., I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT, WAS INTERESTING TO US IS WE, LAUNCHED A PARTNERSHIP WITH, COSTCO FOR MEMBERS WHERE THEY, COULD GET ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, HEALTHCARE ACROSS PRIMARY CARE,, MENTAL HEALTH CARE, YOU NAME, IT., THE MOST POPULAR SINGLE, CATEGORY SEARCHED FOR WAS, WEIGHT LOSS., SO NOT A HUGE SURPRISE GIVEN WE, KNOW ACROSS THE UNITED STATES,, THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO, STRUGGLE WITH THEIR WEIGHT, WHO, ARE DEALING WITH OBESITY OR, BEING OVERWEIGHT AND HAVE MANY, COMORBIDITIS., IT'S A HOT TOPIC IN THE UNITED, STATES RIGHT NOW., >> OF COURSE WHEN PEOPLE THINK, OF COSTCO, THEY THINK OF BUYING, FOOD IN BULK., ISN'T THERE SOMETHING IRONIC, ABOUT OFFERING A WEIGHT LOSS, DRUG THAT MAKES PEOPLE LESS, HUNGRY AT COSTCO?, >> I WON'T SPEAK FOR COSTCO., I THINK THOSE GUYS RUN A, FANTASTIC BUSINESS., WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THEY, CERTAINLY SEEM VERY INTERESTED, IN HELPING THEIR MEMBERS FIND, GREAT, AFFORDABLE OPTIONS, ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF, CATEGORIES., THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CATEGORY,, AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THE, WEIGHT LOSS CATEGORY., WHETHER THAT'S VIA DIET AND, EXERCISE, NEW FORMS OF PHYSICAL, ACTIVITY, OR WHETHER IT'S, ASSISTED BY A MEDICATION, WE'RE, EXCITED TO WORK WITH THEM WITH, THAT AND HAVE THE CLINICIANS ON, SESAME MEET THEIR MEMBERS WHERE, THEY ARE AND HELP THEM GET TO A, MORE HEALTHY AND EFFECTIVE, WEIGHT., >> AND MICHAEL, WHO CAN, ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS, SERVICE?, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE TO, BE A COSTCO SUBSCRIBER, BUT CAN, YOU DO THIS PURELY FOR WEIGHT, LOSS?, IS THERE SORT OF A, IS THERE A, RANGE OF HOW MUCH WEIGHT YOU, HAVE TO BE OR HOW HEAVY YOU, HAVE TO BE OR YOUR BMI OR, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?, >> WELL, SURE., I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT THIS, WAY., ANYBODY WHO'S INTERESTED IN, WEIGHT LOSS CAN SEE A CLINICIAN, ON SESAME WHO'S TRAINED IN THE, FIELD, BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, IN TAKING ONE OF THE NEWER GLP, 1 MEDICATIONS, YOU'RE RIGHT,, THAT'S A MORE LIMITED SUBSET OF, PATIENTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE., IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE CLINICALLY, OBESE OR ARE CLINICALLY, OVERWEIGHT WITH A MEANINGFUL, NUMBER OF RISK FACTORS., THINGS LIKE HYPERTENSION, FOR, EXAMPLE., IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING TO LOSE, 10 POUNDS AFTER HAVING A CHILD,, PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT PATH FOR, YOU TO TAKE., I WOULDN'T EXPECT A GLP-1 TO BE, APPROPRIATE., IF YOU'RE BEEN STRUGGLING TO, LOSE 30, 40, 50 POUNDS FOR, QUITE A WHILE AND YOU'RE, EXPERIENCING THE HEALTH EFFECTS, FROM CARRYING EXCESS WEIGHT,, SOME OF THESE MEDICATIONS COULD, BE AN OPTION FOR YOU., >> MICHAEL, WE APPRECIATE THAT., WHEN WE COME BACK, THE SAFARI, NIGHTMARE., VIDEO SHOWING AN ELEPHANT, CHARGING AT A SAFARI VEHICLE, AND FLIPPING IT OVER., AN 80-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN KILLED., AFTER FOUR HOURS OF, NEGOTIATIONS,

SITTING DOWN WITH A GROUP OF, VOTERS IN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY TO, DISCUSS THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE, PRESIDENTIAL RACE., >> Reporter: GOOD EVENING, TOM., THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN NOW SAYS, THEY BELIEVE FLORIDA IS, WINNABLE FOR THEM COME, NOVEMBER., ONE OF THE CRITICAL COUNTIES IS, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY., I GOT THE OPPORTUNITY RECENTLY, TO MEET WITH A GROUP OF VOTERS., WE MET AT THE HISTORIC BALL AND, CHAIN LOUNGE RESTAURANT IN, LITTLE HAVANA, AN AREA THAT,, TOM, YOU AND I KNOW SO WELL., THEY TOLD US WHAT ARE THE MAIN, ISSUES THAT THEY SEE IN, DETERMINING HOW THEY WILL VOTE, COME NOVEMBER., HERE'S PART OF OUR, CONVERSATION., >> SOUTH FLORIDA REPRESENTS SO, MUCH TO SO MANY., IT IS,IN MANY WAY, A, REPRESENTATION OF THE MELTING, POT OF AMERICA., WE SPOKE WITH VOTERS WITH MANY, DIFFERENT STRONG OPINIONS BUT, UNITED IN CIVILITY., HER PARENTS ARE IMMIGRANTS FROM, HAITI., >> I'M A DEMOCRAT THROUGH AND, THROUGH., >> Reporter: THE DAUGHTER OF, CUBAN EXILES USED TO BE A, DEMOCRAT., SHE SWITCHED TO THE

REPUBLICAN AND THEN SWITCHED TO, DEMOCRAT., HIS PARENTS IMMIGRATED FROM, MEXICO., >> I AM MORE DEMOCRAT., >> Reporter: AND KELLY THOMAS, COMES FROM A MILITARY FAMILY., SHE WAS REGISTERED AS A, DEMOCRAT BUT THEN SWITCHED TO, NO PARTY AFFILIATION., >> AND I HAVE SOME PROGRESSIVE, VALUES., I HAVE SOME CONSERVATIVE, VALUES., >> Reporter: THEY ALL FEEL THE, ECONOMY IS AMONG THEIR TWO TOP, ISSUES THAT INFORM HOW THEY, WILL VOTE IN NOVEMBER., >> PERSONALLY HAVING TO MOVE, BACK IN WITH MY PARENTS INSTEAD, OF MOVING FORWARD AND BEING AN, INDEPENDENT ADULT., I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE, CANDIDATES AND WHOEVER GETS IN, OFFICE IN NOVEMBER TO AT LEAST, ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY IN, HOUSING BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY, SEEING THAT RIGHT NOW., >> Reporter: WHEN IT COMES TO, IMMIGRATION, THESE VOTERS, DISAGREE OVER BORDER POLICIES, AND HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT, THE NEARLY EIGHT MILLION, MIGRANTS WHO HAVE COME TO THE, U.S. SINCE 2021., >> THE HOUSING CRISIS IS NOT A, RESULT OF THE EIGHT MILLION, FOLKS., EVERYBODY LOOK AT MIAMI., THERE'S DEVELOPMENTS GOING UP., THEY'RE BUILDING FOR EVERYONE, ELSE EXCEPT FOR WORKING-CLASS, PEOPLE., AND SO THE QUESTION FOR ME WHEN, IT RELIES ON IMMIGRATION IS, LET'S NOT BLAME IMMIGRANTS FOR, THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE NOT, DEALT WITH, WITH OUR PEOPLE., >> WE NEED TO NOT USE, IMMIGRATION AS JUST A PLATFORM, TO ENRAGE VOTERS OR POINT, FINGERS AT THE OTHER PARTY., I THINK IMMIGRANTS NEED TO BE, TREATED WITH COMPASSION., >> I SEE IMMIGRATION AS AN, OPPORTUNITY IN MOST CASES, BUT, I UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW,, YOU CAN'T ALLOW EVERYBODY IN, BECAUSE THERE'S A PROCESS., EVERYBODY SAYS A TERM I ALREADY, DON'T LIKE, GET IN LINE., BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE THAT ARE, WAITING., FOR THOSE PEOPLE, THERE ISN'T, REALLY A LINE SOMETIMES., >> I HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS WHEN, IT COMES TO THE BORDER., I THINK THE SOUTHERN BORDER, NEEDS TO BE CLOSED., I LOVE THE IDEA THAT EVERYBODY, CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER IS, IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN, DREAM, BUT THAT'S JUST NOT, TRUE., I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME, KIND OF PATHWAY TO HELP PEOPLE, TRULY ATTAIN THE AMERICAN DREAM, WHILE THEY'RE HERE., >> Reporter: WITH JUST SEVEN, MONTHS UNTIL THE NOVEMBER, ELECTION, I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT, THEY WOULD TELL BOTH PRESIDENT, BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP., >> I WOULD TELL BIDEN AND TRUMP, THE SAME THING, THAT AMERICANS, NEED TO COME FIRST., OF COURSE AS A TRUMP SUPPORTER,, I FEEL LIKE DONALD TRUMP, ALREADY DOES THAT, AND I THINK, HE NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT OTHER, ISSUES., I THINK THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE AND, SOMETHING THAT REPUBLICANS, NEVER TALK, AND I'D LOVE TO SEE, DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT, STUDENT LOANS AND THE HOUSING, CRISIS., >> BIDEN, YOU CAN LOSE THIS, ELECTION., I THINK YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO, YOUR CONSTITUENTS., HOUSING, STUDENT LOANS, YOUR, FOREIGN POLICIES, YOU NEED TO, GET IN LINE WITH WHAT'S, HAPPENING WITH WHAT AMERICANS, ARE SAYING, AND YOU NEED TO, RISE TO THE OCCASION., >> ONE THING I WOULD TELL TRUMP, IS DON'T DEMONIZE PEOPLE THAT, ARE HERE,

that in this, episode we'll be talking about sensitive, subject matter because they may want to, watch it with you and talk about it, after coming up the stock market, explained we're at the New York Stock, Exchange with a kids guide to stocks, then new clues in the decades old, mystery what happened to aviation, pioneer Amelia aart also will Punk saton, Phil see Shadow we've got a fun Pop Quiz, just for you plus meet moja the new lion, cub melting hearts at the Fort Worth Zoo, and young genius will introduce you to, one six-year-old with a bright future oh, he joins a special fraternity of people, who are essentially Geniuses well he, wants to be a doctor a medical doctor, cuz I want to help people when they are, sick this is NBC Nightly News Kids, edition welcome back to Nightly News, Kids edition I'm Lester Holt it's always, great to be here with you guys hope, you're having a terrific week we've got, a terrific lineup ahead including a, visit to a special exhibit hoping to, teach kids about the power of lending a, helping hand during a very dark time in, history and then a little bit later on, we'll switch things up and introduce you, to the dolphin News Network team good, morning Dolphins I'm Presley and, wait where's Arthur and I'm Arthur and, today is Tuesday October 3rd now please, stand for the Pledge of Allegiance we, can't wait for you to meet these, students and hear their inspiring, message for kids but first we want to, begin with a topic that's in the, headlines often you might have heard the, term stock market in the news or perhaps, overheard your parents talking about it, at the dinner table well the stock, market is where people can buy and sell, something called shares of certain, companies to try to make money but what, exactly is a share and why is the stock, market a big deal with the help of our, friend CNBC anchor and host Jim Kramer, our kids edition correspondent Lucy, visited the New York Stock Exchange here, in New York to find, out every weekday at the New York Stock, Exchange something called the opening, bell rings at 9:30 a.m. the Bell signals, to people around the world that stock, trading can officially begin if you've, ever heard in a adult talking about the, stock market this is the place where it, all starts and it's pretty wild so first, things first just what exactly is a, stock a stock is a piece of a company, not the actual physical part of the, company but a part ownership of a, company think of it like this say your, friend Eric opens his own lemonade sand, and is making money and then you decide, you want to own a piece of his company a, stock is sort of like this but on a, bigger scale and the stock market is way, more than just a place it's a system for, buying and sell selling Investments, ownerships in certain companies which, are ways to make money grow I wanted to, find out more so I went straight to the, source my mission is simple to make you, money Jim Kramer covers the stock market, on a CNBC show mad money for those of us, who don't know can you please explain, what the stock market is and how it, works okay the stock market is a very, complicated thing but what it does is it, represents companies it's an actual, Market I want you to think like you're, at the supermarket there's all different, things lined up and each one's different, and they represent a product well the, stock market's like that there's all, these different companies and they're, all lined up and you can buy one and, what you're doing is you're buying a, share in the company when you buy a, stock you're actually purchasing a tiny, share of ownership in the company that, means if the company's profits grow your, share could be worth more money than you, originally paid for it and you can, eventually sell it to make a profit of, your own and since you technically own, part of the company you also get to have, a say in big decisions what it means to, own a stock is you get to be able to use, that share to vote for or against things, that Management's doing including the, CEO and of course you can sell or buy it, depending upon whether you want to be, bigger in it or you want to reduce your, position one share might cost a few, dollars or it could cost hundreds of, dollars those prices change every single, day depending on a lot of different, things like how much money a company, makes or loses and how many people are, buying or selling shares in the company, historically markets go up in the long, term which is why a lot of people, recommend buying shares and holding on, to them for a really long time however, it's also important to know that when, you invest in a company there's always a, risk you could lose money what is the, first stock you ever bought first stock, I ever bought was a company called, American, agronomics it was uh I bought 10 shares, it was an Orange Grove and uh the next, thing that happened was they had a frost, and it got destroyed the stock went to, zero and I lost everything since then J, must done a lot better and he shared, some advice for kids who might be, interested in the stock market how much, money can you make from investing and, how much can you L well I think that you, can kind of make an unlimited amount if, you start at your age anyone of the, parents who are watching they should be, putting money away for you right now and, all the people your age and every put a, little more in at the end of the year, put money in and then you'd be surprised, how much money you can have I'm 12 what, investment advice do you have for me so, that I can retire by 30 to retire by, 30 uh okay for someone who who wants to, retire at 30 you have to take a huge, amount of risk uh and I prefer not to, take that much risk on people I like to, think well listen my stocks maybe you, can retire when you get older 30 is you, got to make a lot of money in the stock, stock market to be able to retire at 30, maybe too much and take too much risk of, course before you make any financial, investments you should check with your, parents or give Jim a call and get his, advice first for Nightly News Kids, edition I'm, Lucy Lucy thanks a lot I think we all, learned a lot there now to another story, making headlines this week new Clues are, surfacing in the decades long mystery of, what happened to Aviation Trailblazer, Amelia Airhart who disappeared while, attempting to fly around the world back, in the 1930s let's get more from our, friend Emily, aeta Amilia arhart was an American, aviation pioneer she was the first, female Aviator to fly solo across the, Atlantic Ocean in 1932 earning her the, distinguished flying cross the first, ever given to a woman I hope to, accomplish something really, scientifically worthwhile for aviation, in the years that followed aart, continued to soar to new heights, including becoming the first person to, fly solo across the Pacific Ocean from, Honolulu Hawaii to Oakland's California, Amia airart prepared to take off on her, last flight then in 1937 airheart set, out to fly around the world with her, Navigator Fred Nunan in a twin engine, aircraft the huge locked Electra sailed, off on a planned round the world trip, her aim ostensibly was to gather weather, information but on July 2nd their plane, vanished over the Pacific, Ocean a search operation got underway, but no one ever found them or the plane, aart and Nunan were declared lost at, sea and for almost 90 years the mystery, of what happened to The trailblazing, Aviator Amelia aart has intrigued, Generations now one man bent on solving, the mystery says he's found a major clue, Tony Romeo believes this sonar image, could show air heart's plane which was, never recovered at the bottom of the, Pacific Ocean well you'd be hard pressed, to convince me it's anything but an, aircraft for one and uh two that it's, not aelia's aircraft Romeo a pilot and, former Air Force intelligence officer, started a deep sea exploration company, and funded an expedition to the possible, site of the wreckage last year in, December the team was reviewing the, sonar data collected by a, state-of-the-art underwater drone when, something caught their eye I mean it was, surreal moment a sonar expert telling, NBC News it's too soon to say for sure, that the images show a plane let alone, air Hearts but that it's an exciting, possibility worth going back to confirm, but Romeo is confident there's no other, known crashes in the area um and, certainly not of that era um and that, kind of design with the tail that you, see clearly in the image the image was, taken within 100 miles of Howland Island, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, airart and her Navigator expected to, land there in July 1937 for a refueling, stop on her journey Around the World Air, hard in the plane never arrived since, then several Expeditions have sought to, find clues about what happened without, success now Romeo's team will return to, the site hopefully later this year so, the next step is confirmation then, there's a lot we need to know about it, and it looks like there's some um damage, or I mean it's been sitting there for, for 87 years at this point hoping to, find answers about the fate of an, aviation Legend under the sea I think, myself it is the greatest mystory of all, time and certainly the most Aviation, mystery of all, time Emily thanks I've always been, fascinated by that story we want to turn, now to a story that we hope will inspire, you to help each other and your, neighbors you may have heard or learned, about the Holocaust in school it was a, very sad and scary time during World War, II where millions of Jewish people had, their lives taken from them this week we, want to share with you a story of what, happens when people come together and, help others how one country saved nearly, its entire population of Jews it's a, part of history now featured in a new, children's exhibition here in New York, City our friend Harry Smith has details, and kids you should probably grab a, parent or grownup to watch with you all, right so if you want to we have Eric, over here I go to the Jewish school and, this new K move from Austria a most, unusual exhibit well they don't seem to, be giving the Jews here a hard time, Holograms telling a story of Horror and, heroism in Europe during World War II, being Jewish meant imprisonment and, death for more than 6 million the, Holocaust what was going on in Europe at, the time and how the Danes and the, Danish response to Nazi occupation was, completely different from the experience, of the Jews in other parts of Europe but, the Jews of Denmark believed they were, safe for much of the war they were and, literally overnight the Jews went into, hiding, and their neighbors work together with, resistance and just all their countrymen, to save 95% of the Jews who were fed to, Safety in Sweden in tiny little boats, curator Ellen Barry at the Museum of, Jewish Heritage describes an armada of, goodness One mission at a time 10 to 15, people rowboats kayaks fishing boats and, 95% of the population was saved the, voyage to neutral Sweden was not a great, distance but to avoid capture some trips, took more than a dozen hours the Danes, risk their own lives to save the lives, of their neighbors and we see that, throughout the entire exhibit the one, thing that they can take from it is to, is to help when they can no matter what, it is it's a miracle so many of us made, it to Sweden high school student imin, Williams portrays Rebecca a Jewish, Refugee in Denmark and it gets so cold, in Winter that sometimes I wake up with, the sheets action be, Frozen and when you're gone in real life, im's own grandfather was one of the more, than 7,000 Jews whose lives were saved, by the Danes in 1943 did you feel, honored to have the chance to do that, yes definitely um I like telling that, story and I'm glad that kids and also, people my age and up can see it like I, want my friends to go see this so that, they, know more about the story of the, Holocaust than they think because I, certainly learned a lot especially, playing the RO IM IM Charlotte con is, im's Mom we wondered what lessons her, father shared having been rescued by the, Danes he always taught us to be tolerant, Live and Let Live accept people for who, they are we can all get along it doesn't, have to be us and them it was very much, because of what happened to him in 1943, that then informed who he was later and, what he educated us to be the Nazis were, allowed to just close down the exhibit, designed for students nine and older, looks to be reaching its audience it, needs to be shared it needs to be cast, down from by families by friends it, needs to people need to know that this, stuff has happened so history does not, repeat itself at the end the quote where, we weren't Heroes we just did what was, right and that as simple as that and I I, think i' take away that you should try, to help others in the community and like, do as much as you can to help others, it's beautiful AB it's absolutely, beautiful students were asked to reflect, in writing what they experienced it also, shows that no matter who you are or how, old you are you can help make change in, the, world Harry thanks so much for that all, right let's switch gears now time for, our pop quiz which has something to do, with what is happening this week, Groundhog Day the tradition takes place, every year on February 2nd in the US and, the best known Groundhog Day ceremony, occurs in patani Pennsylvania this, Annual Festival traces its Origins back, to the late, 1800s the idea is that if a groundhog, emerges from its burrow and sees its, shadow it will Retreat to its den and, winter will go on for six more weeks if, it does not see it Shadow spring will, arrive early so the question groundhogs, have a lot of different nicknames which, of these is not a nickname for, groundhogs is it a woodchucks B Whistle, Pigs C muskrats I'll give you a few, seconds to think about, it okay time's up the answer is C, muskrats muskrats are a semi aquatic, rodent while groundhogs Whistle Pigs and, wood Chucks are all nicknames for this, one species of ground squirrel they, burrow underground to protect themselves, from predators and hibernate during, winter and yes so every February 2nd, lots of people keep an eye on the famous, Brown hog punks saton Phil all right now, for our picture of the week let's head, to Texas where the Fort Worth Zoo is, celebrating the recent birth of a male, lion cub the Cub was born back in, October and is the first Cub born at, this Zoo since 2015 and since this is, the first Cub born to his mom the zoo, named the Cub moja which means number, one in Swahili here's a fun fact did you, know lion cubs are born with their eyes, closed their eyes open several days, after birth the zoo says moja is still, spending time behind the scenes bonding, with Mom and they are keeping a close, eye on his development meantime it was a, big day for one of the Cincinnati zo's, most famous and beloved residents Fiona, the hippo just turned seven just like, many of us she celebrated her birthday, with a cake and other treats back in, 2017 Fiona was born 6

they, ask to be featured or they say that they, really liked what I did just kind of, makes me proud they know I'm having a, positive influence at the younger, students that attend the school yeah you, know I get a lot of questions sometimes, how we decide what stories to include in, a given newscast I'm sure you're asked, that a lot to walk me through a day how, do you decide what to cover and how do, you get the information to your, classmates so um it kind of starts uh, where we arrive in class uh it's our, first class of the day and we all have, about two minutes to settle in and then, our teachers play the episode that we, recorded the day previous we watch it, back see if there's any improvements to, be made and if we can try to apply what, we've learned from past uh um failures, to apply to make our episodes better, this is student may worked hard on this, new episode Fresh B segments Alissa, Kabir in many ways this is a class, you're learning even as you were doing, in this case doing being putting on a, newscast yes yeah and Presley what kind, of reaction are you getting from, classmates and teachers oh main I get a, funny reaction I like to add character, to each episode that goes out in the, field I try to get feedback you know, maybe thing we can do on a new episode, maybe a new feature a new interview from, one of the littles that go here well I, think I've mentioned this on the on our, broadcast before but I used to do school, announcements myself back in the day and, here I am working in news still are, either of you interested in a career in, journalism uh I'm interested in the, technical side of it uh I enjoy just, doing our little small school recordings, but I don't think I want to do like, major time but maybe like a background, editor or something how about you, Presley um I've always kind of wanted to, do something that maybe had to do with, news I watching news I kind of grew up, watching news of my grandfather when I, was younger so I've always kind of had a, passion for delivering the news to the, world well I've got a little bit of, experience in this do either of you have, any questions for me how do you make, sure you can find an interesting story, every day you know that's a good, question we have a lot of different, producers and not only producers but, anyone who works here can come and we, call pitch an idea they can say hey I, saw something on the way to work today, or I heard about this we should look, into it and make it into a story and so, from that group of pitches and different, submissions by employees we kind of, decide what we want to bite off at what, time and how we want to go about doing, it what's it like having to like travel, around the world and cover different, stories well the travel is is actually, one of the fun things for me I enjoy, traveling around the world and meeting, new people and seeing you know world, leaders and just really getting in touch, with a you know a place that I'm not, familiar with um it can be very, demanding though in terms of you have to, be a lot of places in a very short, amount of time and sometimes we have to, get quite creative with our travel as to, you know whether we can get there how, we'll get there how do we get back um, because we're going to places sometimes, that aren't easily accessible or may, have other obstacles uh that prevent us, from going or at least doing it in a in, in the manner that we'd prefer I, appreciate your questions Arthur and, Presley from Dolphin News Network thank, you so much for joining our

BIDEN AT., THIS IS THE POLL WE CONDUCTED., TRUMP GOT BEAT IN 2020 AND H, WAS AT 44 HEADED INTO REELECTION, YEAR, BUSH SENIOR GOT BEAT IN 92, HE, WAS AT 42., HEADED SOUTH RAPIDLY THERE, THAT IS THE LOWEST FOR AN NB, POLL FOR AN INCUMBENT FACING, REELECTION, IT IS A TIGHT RACE WHEN YOU POLL, BIDEN VERSUS TRUMP AT THE STAR, OF THE YEAR., BIDEN HAD A 2 POINT ADVANTAGE., NOW AT THE END OF THE YEAR, TRUMP ON AVERAGE HAS A 2 POINT, ADVANTAGE BUT A VERY CLOSE RACE., WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS OF VOTERS?, IF THIS RACE MATERIALIZES, JOE, BIDEN IS THE OLDEST PRESIDEN, EVER AT THIS POINT, HIS PHYSICAL FITNESS, AGE, THREE, IN FOUR VOTERS SAY THE MAJOR O, MODERATE CONCERNS THEY SEE I, 2024 WILL BE THE LEGAL, SITUATION, CONVICTIONS, WHAT, GOES ON IN THE COURTROOM FOR, HIM., 62% RIGHT NOW SAY IT IS A

SHOWING YOU I, MATCHING TRUMP AGAINST A GENERIC, DEMOCRAT, TRUMP LOSES SIZABLY., BIDEN AGAINST A GENERI, REPUBLICAN, BIDEN LOSES., SO THERE IS NOT A BIG APPETITE, FOR TRUMP VERSUS BIDEN ALTHOUG, IT SEEMS LIKE EACH PARTY I, GOING INTO THAT DIRECTION., AND A POLL FROM WALL STREE, JOURNAL RECENTLY INCLUDED, BUNCH OF THIRD PARTY OPTIONS, AGAINST BIDEN AND TRUMP AND THEY, ADDED UP TO 17%., THAT IS A BIG QUESTION, WILL THERE BE A REAL THIRD PARTY, CANDIDATE TO CREATE A WILD CAR, IN THIS?, >> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU FOR BREAKING IT DOWN, FOR US, >>> HISTORY WASMADE IN THE, COURTROOM THIS YEAR WITH

JUDGE, IT JUST REQUIRES A JUDGE'S, SIGNATURE., IN THIS CASE, FOR THE HEARIN, FOR THAT SIGNATURE, THE JUDG, ASKED A QUESTION WHICH REVEALE, THAT BOTH PARTIES HAD MAJORL, DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT, THIS PLEA AGREEMENT WAS SUPPOSED, TO MEAN., AS A RESULT, WE HAD THE PLEA, DEAL FALL THROUGH AND THEN, CRIMINAL CHARGES BROUGHT AGAIN, AGAINST HUNTER BIDEN FOR ALLEGED, DRUG USE WITH A GUN FILING AND, TAX CHARGES BROUGHT IN, CALIFORNIA, WHAT IS MOST IRONIC FOR US LEGAL, ANALYSTS IS THAT WE HAVE BOT, BIDEN AND TRUMP NOT EGREEING O, MUCH BUT THEY AGREE THAT THE, ARE BEING TARGETED POLITICALLY, BY THIS PROCESS WHEN THIS LIKELY, WOULD NOT ARE HAVE HAPPENED, YEAR AGO, >> FASCINATING, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT TH, SUPREME COURT., ONE OF THE BIGGEST DECISIONS, MAKING SO MANY HEADLINES WAS,

TAMPERED WITH THE JURY, AND ALLEGEDLY TOLD THE JURY NO, TO BELIEVE MURDAUGH'S TESTIMONY., NOW IF THAT FACT PATTERN I, TRUE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE, GETS A NEW TRIAL THE NEXT YEAR, >> WOW, MORE TO COME

Uh that's Robert L, . Peters Robert L. Peters is the, fake name he gave himself while, he was vice president of the, United States conducting all, kinds of business. It looks like, overseas and in conjunction with, his son on company time on, American time. This is an, official email preparation that, is national security staff was, doing for him prior to a call., With the president of Ukraine, and, yeah, CCDs hunter and look, at the top. Peters. Robert L., That apparently was the, pseudonym for and it wasn't just, that one. He also used the name, Robin, where Personal, communication with his beautiful, boy Hunter really later on thick, , my beautiful son. He was 42, years old. It's nice, but it's I, don't know. And remember this, moment from the debate I don't, make money from China. You do., Had had moved that head movie, thought. Look at this. Wow He, caught me. What was he thinking?, When his head went back like, that? How did you figure that, out? Well we all know now that, he was not telling the truth, when Biden replied this way. My, son has not made money in terms, of this thing about what are you, talking about? China I have not, had the only guy made money from, China is this guy? He's the only, one. Nobody else has made money, from China wrong. Even Hunter., Biden's lawyers have admitted, that as part of that joint, Chinese venture, Hunter received, his portion of good faith seed, funds that's from Hunter,, Biden's own attorney. And what, do they do? That money for some, bizarre reason. He shared it, with his uncle and his ex wife, and his present wife and his, girlfriend and Oh, just a insane, situation now, thanks to the, House Oversight Committee. We, know a lot. Now let's see from, China. How much money At least, $3 million transferred to the, Biden family or Biden Family, Associates from Romania. $1, Million, at least from Ukraine., $17 million. We're talking. This, is very, very serious money. And, so much of this information is, thanks to the House Oversight, Committee, which is chaired by, Congressman James Comer,, Republican of Kentucky. Sir, Welcome back. How are you, tonight? Um Well, thank you. You, bet. Now uh Robert L. Peterson, in I, uh I wonder why he chose, that name. Are we wrong here? I, know you're looking for more, stuff from the national, Archives. But what do you know, about Robert L. Peterson. Well, we know that it was a fake name, of used and how ironic is that, that the Biden family we've, unveiled had 20 fake shell, companies that they used to, launder money from our, adversaries around the world To, why not use a fake name while, you're vice president to, disguise the fact that you're, coordinating with your son, who,, by the way, you said You had a, wall between the government side, in the in the business side of, Hunter Biden, but this whole, thing is a joke, and it's all, coming unraveled. It's taken a, while to figure out but we've, been following the Monday We, followed emails. We follow text, messages, and we figured out, that he was using a fake name, pertaining to his preparation to, go to Ukraine to fire the, prosecutor. And remember, we've, seen on tape. We're Joe Biden, said, Well, son of a B. They, fired the prosecutor. That's, what this was all about. Why was, he using a fake name? And why in, the world was the government, Sisi and his son to let him know, about the all the preparation, for Ukraine? So uh, you've, reached out to the archives. I, believe we have some of those, emails. You just saw him. We got, him from the Marco Polo Project,, which we trust. They've been, very good on this stuff. You, think there's a lot more out, there and it doesn't seem I, don't sense that the archives, are going to be very, cooperative. Well we'll see, about the archives. But yes,, there are more out there and we, believe there are some archives, that are public, but they've, been redacted. So much of the, information I get from the, government is redacted. We, believe that there are some, emails that would fit this, pattern that have redactions. So, we've asked the National, Archives to give us the, unredacted version. So that we, can use this in our, investigation determined whether, or not this president is, compromised, and I think most of, us know the answer to that. But, for the mainstream media, we, need more evidence. So uh, every, day we produce more evidence,, and this is another example. So, the National Archives is the, entity that our committee the, Oversight committee has, jurisdiction over that. That's, supposed to be in charge of, these records. They've been in, the news a lot because both, President Trump and President, Biden both been accused of, mishandling classified document, that through the national, archive, so we want to see if, the National Archives is truly a, fair entity. They know about, this investigation. They know, the severity of the, investigation. They know that, the vice president Has been, accused of taking a bribe. They, know there's mounting evidence, that the family has received, millions and millions of dollars, from our adversaries around the, world. Now there's emails with, that the vice president's office, was using to disguise that they, were being sent to Joe Biden a, fake name and copying his son, who wasn't a an employee of the, government. We hear the Democrat, tell that that was 100. Biden, wasn't in office Hunter Biden, didn't work for the government., Well, why was Hunter Biden?, Getting copied on emails about, Ukraine policy when he was a, director of a corrupt energy, company in Ukraine. Let's look, at that email again if we could., From the introduction, we had, the email itself to the boss,, which is Joe Biden back when he, was vice president, and we see, that hunter is C seed. You know,, I keep hearing from the fake, news. There is no smoking gun,, no smoking gun, tying any of, this to Two Joe Biden. I think, that might be that might be the, smoking gun or I mean, it's may, not be a high caliber weapon,, but that's a weapon. Right there, . This is this is dynamite and, it obviously they denied it. But, this is What do you agree? Yeah, This is this is obviously time, Joe Biden in on this scandal,, and we're going to see the real, quick pro quo in Ukraine wasn't, Donald Trump, calling Zelinsky, asking about corruption? It was, Joe Biden actually going to, Ukraine on Air Force two, dangling foreign aid in front of, the then president. Of Ukraine,, the Manning that he far a, prosecutor that was, investigating his son's energy, company that was clearly engaged, in corruption in Ukraine, and, then the president, then Vice, President Biden accomplished, that probably the only thing, he's ever accomplished from a, foreign policy standpoint, and, then does an interview and brags, about it. All the evidence is, here. So we're going to continue, to press for more information., We believe there's more evidence, that's been redacted by the, National Archives, and we're, calling on them to unredacted, that and present them to the, House Oversight Committee. You, know more money. Billions of, dollars are going to Ukraine. Um, kind of it's almost automatic., Now. I know there's a lot of, support for that in the, government. But some of us are, kind of skeptical at this point,, and it's just like to Yeah,, right to and you know, not only, do we not have a good idea of, where all that money is going,, the more that I'd cover with, respect to corruption with Joe, Biden in Ukraine, the worse it, sounds that Joe Biden continues, to request from Congress., Billions and billions of dollars, more to send the Ukraine. I, mean, this whole thing stinks., The vice president and the, current president, United States, , Joe Biden has lied for years, about his involvement in Ukraine, , and here we are sending more, and more money than Ukraine. It, just looks really bad and the, president is going to have to, come clean about. What Ali did, with respect to corruption and, bribery and in Ukraine. Finally, real quick. The media coverage., Um you know, I feel like, Mainstream media dominant media, . They have ignored it or they, minimized it, and they made, excuses. Every now and then, they'll write abiding peace, but, you know, it's They're they're, They're living in denial. As far, as I can see, I love for that to, change. We're going to keep, producing more evidence. I'm not, worried because I know that, there's gonna come a time when, they're going to have to talk, about it. They keep moving The, goal post. The last excuse was, that well, you've never tied Joe, into any of this. Well, this, email today is pretty pretty, darn explosive with respect to, Joe Biden using a fake name and, copying his son. About a trip., He was going to take the fire. A, prosecutor investigating his son, for corruption. So uh, I think, the evidence is overwhelming,, and the mainstream media could, continue to not talk about it., But the American people are, keeping up with this, and that's, one reason Joe Biden continues, to lose the confidence of, everyday Americans. As we say, goodbye, Congressman if I can, see that email one more time., This Really? This is something, this really is something, prepping for the call with, Poroshenko. Robert L. Peters is, the vice president Sisi Hunter, Biden. He's gonna He's gonna be, potentially on that phone call, very quickly. Do we know if, Hunter may have been on that, phone call? We don't know yet,, but we know some people that, we're going to probably be, bringing in very soon, and, they're going to have a lot of, time to think about whether or, not they're going to tell us the, truth. So we'll find out a lot, of thing","shortTranscript":"we followed emails we followed text, messages and we figured out that he was, using a fake name pertaining to his, preparation to go to Ukraine to fire the, prosecutor and remember we've seen him, take where Joe Biden said well son of a, bee they fired the prosecutor's not, fired you're not getting the money well, son of a, got fired that's what this was all about, uh why was he using a fake name and why, in the world was the government CC and, his son to let him know about all the, preparation for Ukraine this whole, thing's a joke and it's all coming, unraveled it's taken a while to figure, out but we've been following the money, uh"},{"file":"result-NewsNation-139.json","long":"https://youtu.be/4F3rVG6jVUY","short":"https://youtu.be/QblIK9TUJbE","similarity":0.84,"max":0.21,"TranscriptSimilarity":0.89407,"TitleSimilarity":0.89848,"shortCommonWords":146,"common":30.66,"longTitle":"Chris Christie drops out of 2024 race | The Hill","shortTitle":"Chris Christie drops out of 2024 presidential race","shortAt":"2024-01-11T00:50:35.000Z","longAt":"2024-01-10T23:16:35.000Z","longTranscript":"AND OUR COUNTRY TO A NEW PLACE, OF HOPE AND OPTIMISM IN THIS, COUNTRY.

BY DEBATE, NUMBER THREE YOU CALLED NIKKI, HALEY CORRUPT, ACCUSED RON, DESANTIS OF WEARING HIGH HEELS,, AND TOLD AMBASSADOR HALEY TO, KEEP A CLOSER EYE ON HER, DAUGHTER. CAN YOU SEE HOW THIS, HAS LED SOME TO CONCLUDE YOU, AND TO QUESTION YOUR, AUTHENTICITY?, >> MEGYN, THERE'S A TIME AND, PLACE FOR EVERYTHING. WE NEED, SOMEBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO, ABSOLUTELY IS GOING TO BE A, FIGHTER WHEN IT COUNTS. I DID, ON THAT STAGE IN THAT THIRD, DEBATE. DOUG WAS ON THAT STAGE, AT THAT TIME. AND RON DESANTIS, GO BACK TO NIKKI HALEY'S, COMMENTS EARLIER THAT SHE IS, NOT RESPONDING TO THE WILL OF, THESE DONORS. YOU WERE BANKRUPT, >>> WELCOME BACK TO THE, REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DETE LIVE, ON NEWS NATION FROM TUSCALOOSA,, ALABAMA. WE ARE NOW GOING TO GO, TO THE CRISIS ON THE SOUTHERN, BORDER. POLLS SHOW IMMIGRATION, AND THE CRISIS ARE AMONG THE, MOST PRESSING ISSUES FOR, REPUBLICAN VOTERS RIGHT NOW., CROSSING ILLEGAL LEAGUE INTO, OUR COUNTRY, AND THE SEPARATE, ISSUE WITH FENTANYL BEING, SMUGGLED IN MOSTLY THROUGH, LEGAL PORTS OF ENTRY. ALL YEAR, BORDER DOCUMENTING THE CRISIS, IN 2023 ALONE. BORDER PATROL, ENCOUNTERED A RECORD 2., MILLION MIGRANTS. ALL FOUR OF, YOU HAVE TALKED TOUGH. THE, QUESTION NOW IS HOW REALISTIC, IS THE TALK? SO GOVERNOR, DESANTIS, I'D LIKE TO START, WITH YOU. YOU HAVE PLEDGED TO, SEND THE MILITARY TO THE, SOUTHERN BORDER ON DAY ONE OF, YOUR ADMINISTRATION WITH ORDERS, TO SHOOT, \"STONE COLD DEAD\", A BACKPACK THAT YOU BELIEVE, CONTAINS FENTANYL. PEOPLE CALL, THIS SHOOT FIRST ASK QUESTIONS, LATER POLICY, THAT WOULD AMOUNT, LEADER. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS, IDEA OF YOURS WOULD BE LEGAL?, >> THE DRUG CARTELS ARE, INVADING OUR COUNTRY AND, KILLING OUR CITIZENS BY THE, TENS OF THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR., WE HAD A SITUATION IN FLORIDA,, THERE WAS AN 18-MONTH-OLD BABY, CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR OF AN, AIRBNB RENTAL. THERE WAS, FENTANYL RESIDUE ON THE CARPET,, AND THE BABY DIED. IS THIS, ACCEPTABLE IN THIS COUNTRY?, THEY DON'T CARE. THEY DON'T, CARE THAT FENTANYL IS RAVAGING, YOUR COMMUNITY. THEY DON'T CARE, RAVAGING OUR COMMUNITY AND, OVERWHELMING OUR COMMUNITY. THE, COMMANDER IN CHIEF NOT ONLY HAS, A RIGHT, BUT YOU HAVE A, RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGHT BACK, AGAINST THESE PEOPLE., >> DOES THAT MEAN SHOOTING, >> IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO, CATEGORIZE THEM AS FOREIGN, TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS,S, AND WE, WILL IDENTIFY JUST LIKE WE, IRAQ, AL QAEDA WASN'T WEARING A, UNIFORM. YOU WOULD SEE ANYONE, WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND, THEY ALL HAD MAN DRESSES ON. SO, YOU HAD TO MAKE A JUDGMENT, BASED ON INTELLIGENCE, POSITIVE, IDENTIFICATION. BUT WE'RE GOING, TO BE ABLE TO GET THE, INTELLIGENCE ON THESE CARTEL, PEOPLE. HERE IS THE THING, IF, WE HAD A WALL ACROSS THE, SOUTHERN BORDER, WHICH I, SUPPORT, THIS WOULD NOT HAVE, HAPPENED. WE NEED TO BUILD A, WALL ACROSS THE SOUTHERN, BORDER. I'LL GET IT DONE AND I, WILL MAKE FOR MEXICO, WHO IS, REMEMBER? I'M GOING TO HAVE, FEES ON REMITTANCES FROM, FOREIGN WORKERS WHEN THEY SEND, THE MONEY BACK TO FOREIGN, COUNTRIES, WE ARE GOING TO TAX, IT, AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD, THE WALL WITH THAT. SO YES, YOU, SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT. BUT WE, DON'T HAVE IT. I'M GOING TO, BUILD IT, BUT WE HAVE TO LEAN, IN ON THIS PROBLEM. I AM NOT, GOING TO SIT THERE AND ALLOW, MOTHERS TO LOSE MORE KIDS, BECAUSE OF FENTANYL OVERDOSE. I, AM NOT GOING TO SIT THERE AND, LET SEX TRAFFICKING GO, UNABATED. THERE IS GOING TO BE, A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN AND THESE, DRUG CARTELS BETTER BUCKLE UP., [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ], >> AMBASSADOR HALEY, YOU HAVE, PLEDGED TO CATCH AND ABORT ALL, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HERE. AND, THEN YOU SAID LAST MONTH YOU, WILL NOT DEPORT THOSE WHO ARE, WORKING AND PAYING TAXES RATHER, THAN FEEDING OFF THE SYSTEM., WHICH IS IT?, >> SO FIRST OF ALL WHAT I SAID, IS ALL OF THE SEVEN OR EIGHT, MILLION ILLEGALS THAT HAVE COME, UNDER BIDEN'S WATCH ABSOLUTELY, HAVE TO GO BACK. WE HAVE TO, STOP THE INCENTIVE OF WHAT'S, BRINGING THEM OVER HERE IN THE, FIRST PLACE. BIDEN JUST GAVE, TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS TO, 500,000 VENEZUELANS. THAT'S A, CARDS. THAT'S A HALF A MILLION, DRIVER'S LICENSE I KNOW AT MY, TIME AT THE UNITED NATIONS, THE, FIRST THING THEY DO IS PICK UP, THE PHONE, WE CAME OVER, COME, MORE. YOU HAVE TO GO AND DEPORT, THESE PEOPLE, SO THEY KNOW IT, CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. FOR THOSE, THAT HAVE BE HERE LONGER THAN, THAT. WE'VE GOT TO START SEEING, WHO IS IT. HOW LONG HAVE THEY, BEEN HERE? HAVE THEY BEEN, VETTED? HAVE THEY PAID TAXES?, HAVE THEY BEEN WORKING, AND, FIGURE OUT WHO ELSE IS OUT, THERE. WHAT I KNOW IS MY, PARENTS CAME HERE LEGALLY. THEY, PUT IN THE TIME, THEY PUT IN, THE PRICE. THEY ARE OFFENDED BY, THOSE WHO ARE COMING IN, ILLEGALLY. WE CAN'T LET THEM, SKIP THE LINE. BUT IF YOU TALK, ABOUT FENTANYL, LET'S LOOK AT, SHOULD SEND SPECIAL OPERATIONS, OVER AND TAKE OUT THE CARTELS., I THINK WE SHOULD REMAIN IN, MEXICO POLICY, SO THEY WOULD, NEVER STEP FOOT IN U.S. SOIL IN, THE FIRST PLACE. BUT LOOK AT, WHERE FENTANYL CAME FROM. LET'S, GO TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER., IT CAME FROM CHINA. THAT'S WHY, WE NEED TO END ALL NORMAL TRADE, RELATIONS WITH CHINA UNTIL THEY, FENTANYL. I PROMISE YOU, THEY, NEED OUR ECONOMY. THEY WILL, IMMEDIATELY STOP THAT. BUT THIS, IS WHERE TRUMP WENT WRONG., TRUMP WAS GOOD ON TRADE. BUT, THAT'S ALL HE WAS WITH CHINA., BECAUSE HERE HE ALLOWED, FENTANYL TO CONTINUE TO COME, OVER. HE CONTINUED TO ALLOW, THEM TO TAKE, HE WOULD GIVE, THEM TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD, BUILD UP THEIR MILITARY AND, HURT US. HE ALLOWED THE CHINESE, INFILTRATION FOR THEM TO BUY UP, FARMLAND TO PUT MONEY IN OUR, UNIVERSITIES, AND TO CONTINUE, TO DO THINGS THAT WERE HARMFUL, BANK IN CUBA AND POLICE, STATIONS, AND TRUMP DIDN'T DO, ANYTHING ABOUT IT., >> I MEAN THIS IS RICH BECAUSE, WHEN SHE WAS GOVERNOR OF SOUTH, CAROLINA, SHE WAS THE NUMBER, THE CCP INTO HER STATE. SHE, WROTE A LOVE LETTER TO THE, CHINESE AMBASSADOR SAYING HOW, GREAT OF A FRIEND CHINA IS. YOU, CAN LOOK AT IT. WE PUT IT ON, OUR WEBSITE. THERE IS ALSO A, VIDEO AS GOVERNOR, STANDING IN, FRONT OF A CHINESE FLAG WITH A, CHINESE BUSINESS SAYING THAT, SHE NOW WORKS FOR THEM. TALKING, SHE HAS BEEN VERY WEAK ON, CHINA. NOW HERE IS THE PROBLEM., THE RHETORIC IS DIFFERENT. BUT, HER DONORS, THESE WALL STREET, LIBERAL DONORS WILL MAKE MONEY, IN CHINA. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO, LET HER BE TOUGH ON CHINA, AND, SHE WILL CAVE TO THE DONORS., SHE WILL NOT STAND UP FOR YOU., >> FIRST OF ALL HE'S MAD, BECAUSE THOSE WALL STREET, DONORS USED TO SUPPORT THEM AND, NOW THEY SUPPORT ME. THE SECOND, CHINESE COMPANY, UGAS, THAT HE, JUST DID A RALLY THERE LAST, YEAR, GIVING YOU $340,000 IN, CAMPAIGN DONATIONS BETWEEN THEM, TIED TO THE POINT. IT'S ANOTHER, ONE. THEY WENT TO EXPAND THEM, AS YOU GAVE TWO MILLION IN, SUBSIDIES., IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. I, EJECT THIS INSTITUTE. SHE, BROUGHT THEM TO THE, UNIVERSITIES IN SOUTH CAROLINA., >> THAT IS NOT TRUE., >> I EJECTED THEM WITH A RECORD, OF STANDING UP DOING WHAT'S, >> YOU HAVE A RECORD OF LYING., >> SHE IS TRYING TO SAY THINGS, LIKE THAT. EVEN THE LIBERAL, MEDIA GROUPS IF I SAY THE SKY, IS BLUE, THEY WILL FACT CHECK, LOOKED AT HER CHARGES SAYING, SHE WAS FALSE, THAT THEY COULD, NOT FIND ONE INSTANCE OF ME, RECRUITING A CHINESE BUSINESS, COMING TO FLORIDA. YOU KNOW, WHY? BECAUSE WE NEVER RECRUITED, ANY CHINESE GOVERNMENT., >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MR., RAMASWAMY, OVER THE PAST YEAR,, FENTANYL HAS KILLED MORE THAN, 75,000 AMERICANS. 1,000 OF THEM, RIGHT HERE IN ALABAMA. YOU HAVE, VOWED TO USE THE MILITARY TO, ANNIHILATE DRUG LABS INSIDE, MEXICO. SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT, OF MEXICO SAID WOULD BE A, HOSTILE ACT. BUT FENTANYL CAN, EASILY BE MADE ANYWHERE. IN, LABS THAT ARE SHUT DOWN, THEY, CAN EASILY AND QUICKLY BE, REPLACED. ARE YOUR TOUGH, ENFORCEMENT POLICIES OFFERING, FALSE HOPE TO A COUNTRY RACKED, BY ADDICTION?, >> TO THE CONTRARY, I DON'T, THINK THAT IT WILL HAVE TO COME, TO THAT IF WE DEAL WITH THE, ACTUAL DEMAND SIDE PROBLEM THAT, WE ALSO HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. I, MEAN THE EASY TALK IS TALKING, ABOUT HOW WE WILL USE THE, MILITARY TO SECURE THE BORDER., I WILL AND I BELIEVE EVERYBODY, ELSE WILL WANT TO DO THE SAME, THING. BUT THE HARDER PART IS, DEALING WITH THE CRISIS OF, PURPOSE AND MENTAL HEALTH, EPIDEMIC, RAGING ACROSS THE, COUNTRY LIKE WILDFIRE. THERE IS, A REASON AFTER THE OPIOID, CRISIS THAT YOU SEE FENTANYL., AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SURE TO, MAKE SURE WE DO IT. THIS ONE IS, WORSE FOR ANY REASONS. THEY'RE, ILLEGALLY LACING IT INTO THE, PHARMACEUTICALS, WHERE IT IS, DANGEROUS. BUT THE REAL FALSE, PROMISE HERE IS THINKING THAT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEALT WITH, THAT UNDERLINING MENTAL HEALTH, EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY BY, JUST DEALING WITH THE DEMAND, SIDE OF IT. BUT I WANT TO GET, BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THE ROOT, CAUSE BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE, ARE COMING FROM LABS IN WUHAN,, CHINA OF ALL PLACES. DRUG, MATERIALS THAT ARE GOING TO THE, DRUG CARTELS THAT THEY ARE, PUMPING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN, BORDER. I THINK IT IS GOING TO, TAKE A U.S. PRESIDENT THAT'S, GOING TO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT, CONVERSATION WITH XI JINPING, AND WHAT JOE BIDEN JUST HAD IN, CALIFORNIA. I'LL TELL XI, JINPING. YOU'LL NOT BUY LAND IN, THIS COUNTRY OR DONATE TO, UNIVERSITIES IN THIS COUNTRY., U.S. BUSINESSES WON'T EXPAND, INTO THE CHINESE MARKET UNTIL, THEY ARE PLAYING BY THE SAME, COUNTRY THAT IS PUTTING, FENTANYL INTO ILLEGAL, PHARMACEUTICALS INTO MEXICO. IT, IS NO COINCIDENT AND THE EXACT, SAME COUNTRY THAT ALSO, UNLEASHED HELL ON THE WORLD, WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WE, ALSO HAVE TO HOLD THEM, ACCOUNTABLE WITH EVERY, FINANCIAL LEVER THAT WE HAVE, AVAILABLE., >> THANK YOU., >> THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO, STAND WITH A SPINE AND YOU MARK, MY WORDS, IF WE'RE WILLING TO, STAND WITH A SPINE, CHINA WILL, ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FOLD BECAUSE, WE'RE IN A TOUGHER SPOT THAN, THEY ARE AND THEY ARE BACK TO, PLAYING WITH THE SAME SET OF, RULES., >> THANK YOU, MR. RAMASWAMY., >>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE, ECONOMY. AMBASSADOR HALEY,, HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN A, PART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, BUT, IT'S INCREASINGLY OUT OF REACH, FOR YOUNGER AMERICANS. THIS, YEAR MORTGAGE RATES REACHED, 30-YEAR HIGHS. HOME PRICES HAVE, RISEN $190,000 OVER THE PAST, AT WORK OR SHOULD THE FEDERAL, GOVERNMENT DO SOMETHING TO MAKE, HOMES RE AFFORDABLE?, >> WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE, EXACTLY RIGHT. MY DAUGHTER JUST, GOT MARRIED, AND I SAW HOW HARD, IT WAS FOR HER AND HER HUSBAND, TO BUY A HOME. RIGHT NOW THE, AVERAGE HOMEOWNER IN AMERICA IS, 49 YEARS OLD. YOU'VE GOT YOUNG, PEOPLE EVERYWHERE THAT USED TO, BE THE AMERICAN DREAM. NOW IT'S, OUT OF REACH. BUT YOU LOOK AT, WHAT HAPPENS. FIRST OF ALL LOOK, AT WHAT THE FED DID. THEY DID A, TERRIBLE JOB WHEN THEY ALLOWED, ALL THAT MONEY TO GO THROUGH., YOU SAW THE TREASURY BOND RATES, GO UP. THAT AFFECTED MORTGAGE, RATES, AUTOMOBILE RATES,, INSURANCE RATES. SO NOW WE HAVE, A HIGH INTEREST RATE. YOU'VE, GOT A SUPPLY ISSUE. ASK ANY, BUILDER. THE SUPPLY ISSUES HAVE, CONTINUED TO BE THERE. THAT'S, CAUSED THE RATE TO GO UP. THEN, YOU'VE GOT INSURANCE THAT HAVE, GONE UP. WHAT YOU HAVE IS A LOT, OF YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T, AFFORD A HOME, BUT TWO, THE, BANKS AREN'T LENDING THEM ANY, MONEY. THEY'VE MADE THE, REGULATION SO HARD THAT THEY, DON'T WANT TO GIVE LOANS ON, MORTGAGES ANYMORE. SO WHAT WE, HAVE TO DO, WE HAVE TO OPEN IT, UP TO GROW OUR ECONOMY, SO THAT, PEOPLE WILL HAVE MORE MONEY IN, THEIR POCKETS. WE'VE GOT TO, LOOK AT THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND, MAKE SURE WE ARE FUNNELING, THAT, SO THE BUILDERS DON'T, HAVE TO SIT THERE TO GO, OVERSEAS TO FIND THINGS. THEN, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE, WILL STOP PAYING DOWN THIS, DEBT, MAKE SURE WE STOP THE, BORROWING, STOP THE SPENDING., I'LL VETO ANY SPENDING BILL, THAT DOESN'T TAKE US BACK TO, PRE-COVID LEVELS. OUR KIDS ARE, NOT GOING TO FORGIVE US FOR ALL, THE SPENDING THAT WILL HAPPEN., TALK ABOUT HOW DONALD TRUMP HAD, A GOOD ECONOMY, $9 TRILLION IN, DEBT, HE DID THAT IN FOUR, YEARS. WE ARE ALL PAYING THE, PRICE OF THAT INCLUDING THOSE, MORTGAGE PRICES., >> WE WILL COME BACK TO, PRESIDENT TRUMP, I PROMISE., GOVERNOR DESANTIS, THE LATEST, NEWS NATION DECISION DESK POLL, FOUND THAT INFLATION TOPS THE, WORRIES OF AMERICAN VOTERS. 61%, SAY THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED AND, THE WORKING CLASS IS HARDEST, HIT. ECONOMIST SAY THIS IS, FUELED BY FEDERAL SPENDING. THE, BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS ADDED, $6 TRILLION TO THE NATIAL, DEBT SO FAR. BUT PRESIDENT, TRUMP WASN'T EXACTLY A PENNY, PINCHER. HIS ADMINISTRATION, ADDED $7.8 TRILLION. DO, REPUBLICANS INCLUDING PRESIDENT, TRUMP SHARE THE BLAME FOR, INFLATION? AND WHAT CONCRETE, STEPS WOULD A PRESIDENT, DESANTIS TAKE?, >> THE BORROWING PRINTING AND, SPENDING OF MONEY WAS BOTH, PARTIES IN WASHINGTON, D.C., THAT'S JUST THE FACT. THESE, REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON HAVE, SPENT, IT'S DRIVEN YOUR PRICES, HIGHER, IT'S DRIVEN YOUR, INTEREST RATES TO THE POINT, WHERE YOU CAN'T AFFORD. I MET A, GRADUATED COLLEGE A COUPLE, YEARS AGO. HE'S LIKE GOVERNOR,, I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. I'M, GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. I CAN'T, >>> WELCOME BACK EVERYONE, YOU, ALL SPENT A LOT OF TIME, CRITICIZING EACH OTHER ON THIS, STAGE AS GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, POINTED OUT AND LESS SO FOR, FOR THIS RACE, DONALD TRUMP. WE, INVITED HIM, BUT WE WOULD LIKE, YOU TO ASK A COUPLE OF, QUESTIONS NOW. AMBASSADOR, HALEY, FORMER TRUMP ANNOUNCED, IF HE'S REELECTED TO BRING BACK, HIS RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION, FROM MUSLIM COUNTRIES. HERE HE, IS IN IOWA ON OCTOBER 16., >> WE WILL ALLOW DANGEROUS, HATERS TO GET RESIDENCY IN OUR, COUNTRY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET, THEM STAY HERE. YOU ARE JUST, DISQUALIFIED., >> AMBASSADOR HALEY, DO YOU, >> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A, STRAIGHT UP MUSLIM BAN AS MUCH, AS YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRIES, WITH TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THAT, WANT TO HURT AMERICANS. YOU CAN, BAN THOSE PEOPLE FROM THOSE, COUNTRIES. THAT'S THE WAY WE, SHOULD LOOK AT IT. WHICH, COUNTRIES ARE A THREAT TO US., YOU LOOK AT WHAT CAME ACROSS, THE SOUTHERN BORDER. WHAT, CAME FROM IRAN, YEMEN, LEBANON,, WHERE THEY SAY DEATH TO, AMERICA. THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT, TO BE CAREFUL. IT IS NOT ABOUT, A RELIGION, BUT A FACT THAT, CERTAIN COUNTRIES ARE DANGEROUS, PRESIDENT HAS ONE JOB AND THAT, IS TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE., THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO TO, MAKE SURE WE HAVE GOOD NATIONAL, SECURITY IN THAT PROCESS AND, THAT'S THE WAY TO LOOK AT IT., WHERE THE TERRORIST THREATS, ARE, HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL, WITH IT. THE BIGGEST THREAT WE, HAVE RIGHT NOW IS COMMUNIST, CHINA. BUT YOU HAVE TO ALSO, LOOK AT WHAT IRAN AND RUSSIA, BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT., THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON, THINGS LIKE CYBER, SPACE,, ARTICIAL INTELLIGENCE. NOT, JUST THE REGULAR THINGS THAT WE, >> AND IT IS NOT JUST TERRORISM, NOW. THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT LOOK, AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN EUROPE., YOU HAVE MORE ANTI-SEMITISM IN, GERMANY THAN ANY TIME SINCE, ADOLPH HITLER, WHY? BECAUSE, THEY IMPORTED MASS NUMBER OF, PEOPLE WHO REJECT THEIR, CULTURE. EUROPE IS COMMITTING, MIGRATION. IT IS ILLEGAL AND, LEGAL. NIKKI HALEY SAID THE, OTHER DAY THERE SHOULD BE NO, LIMITS ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION AND, THAT CORPORATE CEOs SHOULD SET, THE POLICY ON THAT. THERE NEEDS, TO BE LIMITS ON IMMIGRATION. WE, SHOULD NOT BE IMPORTING PEOPLE, FROM CULTURES THAT ARE HOSTILE., FOR EXAMPLE I SAID WITH THE, GAZA, YOU HAD SOME OF THE QUAD, THAT WANTED TO IMPORT 300,000, PEOPLE FROM THE GAZA STRIP. I, ID NO. WE ARE NOT TAKING, ANYONE FROM GAZA BECAUSE OF THE, ANTI-SEMITISM AND BECAUSE THEY, REJECT AMERICAN CULTURE. SO, WE'VE GOT TO GET SMART ABOUT, THIS. WE CANNOT LET THE UNITED, STATES BE LIKE EUROPE., >> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE., >> IF I MAY HIT THIS POINT, BECAUSE IT RELATES TO WHAT THEY, JUST SAID. THERE ARE THINGS, THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO, RIGHT NOW THAT NOBODY IS, TALKING ABOUT AMONGST THE, PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS IN, THIS RACE. WHAT ABOUT ALL OF, THE ILLEGALS WHO ARE ALREADY, HERE? HERE IS THE ANSWER, THERE, IS 287 G IN THE LAW. THAT'S A, PROVISION THAT WILL ALLOW ICE, AGENTS TO DEPUTIZE OR ALLOW, LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO, ENFORCE THOSE I.C.E. WARS. IT, SHOCKS ME NOBODY IN THE, REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE TALKING, ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE ARE ONE, MILLION OFFICIALS. LAW, ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN THIS, COUNTRY. AND AGAINST THAT, BACKDROP, WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE, THE ABILITY TO DEPORT ANYBODY, IN THIS COUNTRY TREMENDOUS, ILLEGALLY. WE WILL TALK MORE, ABOUT THIS., >> THANK YOU. GOVERNOR, CHRISTIE?, >> I ACTUALLY DID THAT AS, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA., >> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, ASKED, LAST NIGHT IN IOWA WHETHER HE, WOULD BE A DICTATOR IF HE WINS, A SECOND TERM IN OFFICE. DONALD, ONE. PROMISING TO SEAL THE, SOUTHERN BORDER. HE HAS ALSO, PLEDGED TO BEGIN THE LARGEST, DEPORTATION OPERATION IN, AMERICAN HISTORY. SAYING, MIGRANTS ARE POISONING THE, BLOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. HE HAS, PLEDGED TO ROUND UP AND EXPEL, AN ESTIMATED 11 MILLION, UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE, UNITED STATES. WHAT DO YOU MAKE, OF THAT PLAN?, >> I THINK IT IS PREDICTABLE. I, MEAN LOOK, HE'S MADE IT VERY, CLEAR. THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO, WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. HE STARTED, OUT THE CAMPAIGN BY SAYING I'M, YOUR RETRIBUTION. EIGHT YEARS, AGO, HE SAID I'M YOUR VOICE., THIS IS AN ANGRY BITTERER MAN, WHO NOW WANTS TO BE BACK AS, PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO, EXACT RETRIBUTION ON ANYONE WHO, HAS DISAGREED WITH THEM. ANYONE, WHO HAS TRIED TO HOLD THEM TO, ACCOUNT FOR HIS OWN CONDUCT., AND EVERY ONE OF THESE POLICIES, HE'S TALKING ABOUT ARE ABOUT, PURSUING A PLAN OF RETRIBUTION, AND YET AT THE FIRST DEBATE, MY, THREE COLLEAGUES ON THIS STAGE, WHEN ASKED IF HE WOULD BE, CONVICTED OF FEDERAL FELONIES, WITH A STILL SUPPORTER TO RAISE, THEIR HANDS, LOOKED INTO THE, CAMERA, AND LET EVERYBODY KNOW, THEY WOULD STILL SUPPORT HIM, FELONIES BY THE WAY. FEDERAL, FELONIES, WHICH WILL INVOLVE, OUR ELECTION PROCESS. FEDERAL, FELONIES, WHICH WILL INVOLVE, THE MOST SENSITIVE OF OUR, GOVERNMENTAL SECRETS. FEDERAL, FELONIES WHERE HE INSTRUCTED, OTHERS TO COMMIT CRIMES. FOLKS, WHO ARE NOW AGREEING TO GO TO, JAIL BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID, IN HIS NAME. SO DO I THINK HE, WAS KIDDING WHEN HE SAID HE WAS, A DICTATOR? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, IS LOOK AT THE HISTORY. THAT'S, WHY FAILING TO SPEAK OUT, AGAINST HIM. MAKING EXCUSES FOR, HIM. PRETENDING THAT SOMEHOW, HE'S A VICTIM EMPOWERS HIM. YOU, WANT TO KNOW WHY THE POLL, NUMBERS ARE WHERE THEY ARE?, BECAUSE FOLKS LIKE THESE THREE, GUYS ON THE STAGE WILL MAKE IT, FEEL LIKE HIS CONDUCT IS, ACCEPTABLE. LET ME MAKE IT, CLEAR. HIS CONDUCT IS, UNACCEPTABLE. HE'S UNFIT. BE, CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU'LL GET IF, YOU EVER GET A DONALD TRUMP, TERM. HE'S LETTING YOU KNOW I, AM YOUR RETRIBUTION. HE'LL ONLY, BE, ELIZABETH, HE'LL ONLY BE, HIS OWN RETRIBUTION. HE DOESN'T, CARE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE., IT IS DONALD TRUMP FIRST., >> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR, CHRISTIE. GOVERNOR DESANTIS?, GOVERNOR DESANTIS? THANK YOU,, THANK YOU. GOVERNOR DESANTIS,, DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE OLDER ON, PRESIDENCY THAN JOE BIDEN WAS, ON DAY ONE OF HIS FIRST. YOU, HAVE SAID TRUMP IS NOT THE SAME, MAN HE WAS WHEN HE RAN IN 2016., YOUR CAMPAIGN IS RUNNING ADS, SHOWING TRUMP CONFUSED. YOU, HAVE SAID HE'S, \"LOST THE ZIP, ON HIS FAST BALL.\" YOU SEEM TO, BE SAYING DONALD TRUMP IS NO, LONGER MENTALLY FIT TO BE, PRESIDENT. IS THAT WHAT YOU, THINK?, >> LOOK, HE IS -- FATHER TIME, IS UNDEFEATED. THE IDEA WE'RE, GOING TO PUT SOMEONE UP THERE, THAT'S ALMOST 80 AND THERE IS, GOING TO BE NO AFFECTS FROM, THAT, WE ALL KNOW THAT'S NOT, TRUE. SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, TO DO A NEXT GENERATION OF, LEADERS AND REALLY BE ABLE TO, MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD. WE, ALSO NEED A PRESIDENT THAT CAN, DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T THINK HE, WOULD BE ABLE TO GET ELECTED., THE DEMOCRATS WANT HIM TO BE, THE NOMINEE. WE SEE THAT. THEY, WILL TURN THE SCREWS. YOU'LL, SEE IT., >> DO YOU THINK HE'S MENTALLY, FIT?, >> I THINK WHEN YOU GET UP TO, 80, IT'S NOT THE JOB FOR THAT., LET ME RESPOND TO SOME OF THE, THINGS THERE. LOOK, THE MEDIA, IS MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT WHAT, PEOPLE THAT IS NOT HOW HE, GOVERNED. HE DIDN'T EVEN FIRE, DR. FAUCI OR CHRISTOPHER WRAY., HE DIDN'T CLEAN UP THE SWAMP., HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DRAIN, IT, HE DID NOT DRAIN IT. HE, SAID HE WAS GOING TO BUILD THE, WALL, WE DON'T HAVE THE WALL., HE DID SAY IN 2016 HE WOULD, HAVE THE LARGEST DEPORTATION, PROGRAM IN HISTORY. HE DEPORTED, LESS THAN BARACK OBAMA DID WHEN, BARACK OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT. SO, SOME OF THESE POLICIES HE RAN, ON, I WAS CHEERING HIM ON THEN,, BUT HE DIDN'T DELIVER IT. HERE, IS WHAT I CAN PROMISE PEOPLE., 100% OF THE THINGS I PROMISED, AS GOVERNOR, I DELIVERED ON, THOSE PROMISES. I BEAT THE LEFT, TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WE'VE GOT, TO START WINNING AGAIN AS A, PARTY, YES, WIN THE ELECTION,, BUT WE'VE GOT TO START GETTING, THESE ISSUES. I'LL GO IN AND, WREAK HAVOC ON THIS, BUREAUCRACY. AND WE WILL BRING, A RECKONING FOR THIS, GOVERNMENT., >> AND HERE IS WHAT WE WILL, UPDATE. YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE TO, WATCH THAT, AND WHAT WAS GOING, ON. THE QUESTION IS VERY, DIRECT. IS HE FIT TO BE, PRESIDENT OR ISN'T HE? THE REST, OF THE SPEECH IS INTERESTING,, BUT COMPLETELY NON-RESPONSIVE., IF WE WERE IN THE COURTROOM, WE, WOULD STRIKE THE ANSWER AND SAY, GOVERNOR DESANTIS., >> NO, THEY WOULDN'T., >> NO, THEY WOULDN'T, THEY, WOULDN'T, CHRIS., >> THEY WOULD STRIKE THE, ANSWER., >> YOU HAVE YOUR THING --, >> NO, I DON'T HAVE MY THING., HERE'S THE THING. WHAT WE DO, NOT WANT TO DO, IT DOESN'T MEAN, THAT HE COULD BE ELECTED. RON,, RON, AND RON? IS HE FIT? AND HE, IS SOMEBODY WHO IS IN THE LIFE, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, >> I'LL COME TO YOU AND FINISH., >> LOOK, FATHER TIME IS, UNDEFEATED. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE, WOULD SCORE ON THE TEST, BUT I, KNOW THIS. WE HAVE AN, AND ELECT SOMEONE FOR TWO, TERMS, WHO IS GOING TO BE, SPITTING NAILS ON DAY ONE AND, FOR EIGHT YEARS, DELIVERING YOU, NOMINATE SOMEBODY WHO IS ALMOST, 80 YEARS OLD., >> HE IS AFRAID TO ANSWER., >> NO, I'M NOT. AND YOU'RE, AFRAID OR YOU'RE NOT LISTENING., HERE IS A SIMPLE QUESTION., >> HOLD ON, GOVERNOR., >> HEY, HEY, HEY, NOBODY CAN, HEAR YOU. THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU., YOU FINISH AND THEN WE'LL GET, IT BACK TO YOU., >> OKAY, LOOK. I'M A SIMPLE, LIKE. I HEAR THE QUESTION AND I, ANSWER IT. IS HE FIT OR ISN'T, HE? I'LL CONCEDE YOU'RE FIT,, RON. YOU'RE NEW GENERATION., YOU'RE 44 YEARS OLD. I WISH I, WAS STILL 44 YEARS OLD, OKAY., >> 45., >> WELL, CONGRATULATIONS. I, STILL TAKE 45. IS HE FIT OR, ISN'T HE? AND THIS IS THE, PROBLEM WITH MY THREE, COLLEAGUES. THEY'RE AFRAID TO, OFFEND. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, >> AND IF YOU'RE AFRAID TO, OFFEND DONALD TRUMP, THEN WHAT, ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN YOU, SIT ACROSS FROM PRESIDENT XI, AND YOU SIT ACROSS, AND YOU SIT, ACROSS FROM PUTIN? YOU HAVE TO, BE WILLING TO OFFEND WITH THE, TRUTH AND ANSWER THE QUESTION., >> OKAY., >> I PROMISE, RON DESANTIS, A, MINUTE., >> AND YOU CAN WAIT AND THEN, WE'RE MOVING ON., >> IT'S ABOUT POINTING OUT DO, YOU WANT TO ELECT SOMEBODY THAT, WILL BE OLDER THAN BIDEN WAS IN, 2021? I DON'T THINK HE IS AS, BAD AS BIDEN WAS AT ALL. BUT I, DO THINK OVER A A UR-YEAR, PERIOD, IT IS NOT A JOB FOR, SOMEBODY THAT'S PUSHING 80. WE, NEED SOMEBODY THAT'S YOUNGER., WE NEED SOMEBODY THAT WILL BE, ABLE TO GO IN THERE AND CLEAN, HOUSE ON DAY ONE AND DO IT FOR, TWO TERMS., >> HERE IS MY ISSUE WITH ALL, THREE OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ON, THIS DEBATE STAGE. IS ALL THREE, OF THEM LICKING DONALD TRUMP'S, BOOTS FOR YEARS, FOR MONEY AND, ENDORSEMENTS? RON DESANTIS,, >>> WELCOME BACK TO THE FINAL, GOP DEBATE OF 2023. STARTING, WITH YOU, HOW REPUBLICANS, YESTERDAY, THEY HAD ELITE, UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS UP TO, CAPITOL HILL TO ANSWER FOR THE, DISPLAYS OF ANTI-SEMITISM ON, COLLEGE CAMPUSES. THESE LEADERS, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF, HARVARD WERE ASKED WHETHER, CALLING FOR THE GENOCIDE OF, JEWS WOULD VIOLATE SCHOOL, POLICIES AGAINST HARASSMENT AND, INTIMIDATION. ALL OF THEM SAID, AND INCLUDING IF THAT WILL VEER, TAKE ON THE NEED TO PREVENT, RADICAL INTIMIDATION OF OTHERS?, >> IT IS DISGUSTING TO SEE WHAT, HAPPENS. IF THIS BEEN THE KKK, CAMPUSES, EVERY ONE OF THOSE, COLLEGE PRESIDENTS WOULD HAVE, BEEN UP IN ARMS. THIS IS JUST, AS BAD. THE IDEA THEY WOULD GO, AND ALLOW THAT KIND OF PRO, HAMAS PROTEST OR AGREE WITH THE, GENOCIDAL JEWS. FIRST OF ALL WE, HAVE GOT TO GET FOREIGN MONEY, OUT OF OUR UNIVERSITIES. YOU'VE, GOT ARAB MONEY, CHINESE MONEY,, YOU'VE GOT OVERS. WE NEED TO GO, TO EVERY UNIVERSITY AND SAY YOU, MONEY, BUT THE DAYS OF TAKING, BOTH ARE OVER. THE SECOND THING, WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED, BIDEN, MADE A MISTAKE NOT INCLUDING, THE DEFINITION OF, ANTI-SEMITISM. IF YOU DON'T, THINK ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO, EXIST, THAT IS ANTI-SEMITIC. WE, WILL CHANGE THE DEFINITION, SO, EVERY GOVERNMENT, EVERY SCHOOL, HAS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE, DEFINITION FOR WHAT IT IS. THE, THIRD THING IS WE NEED TO BAN, TIKTOK ONCE AND FOR ALL AND LET, ME TELL YOU WHY. FOR EVERY 30, MINUTES THAT SOMEONE WATCHES, TIKTOK, EVERY DAY THEY BECOME, 17% MORE ANTI-SOMATIC, MORE PRO, HAMAS BASED ON DOING THAT. WE, NOW KNOW 50% OF ADULTS 18 TO 25, THINK HAMAS WAS WARRANTED IN, WHAT THEY DID WITH ISRAEL., THAT'S A PROBLEM. WHEN CAMPUSES, DON'T GO AND PROTECT AND YOU, HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE SCARED,, WE NEED TO TO TO THE, UNIVERSITIES TO SAY IF YOU'RE, NOT GOING TO PROTECT THESE, STUDENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGE, ANTI-SEMITISM, WE'LL TAKE YOUR, TAX EXEMPT STATUS AWAY. THAT'LL, FIX IT AND TAKE CARE OF IT FOR, GOOD., >> AND STAYING WITH YOU,, AMBASSADOR HALEY. ON OCTOBER 6,, THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT THOUGHT, IT HAD A CLEAR EYED VIEW OF THE, THREAT FROM HAMAS. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK, ATTACK PLAN AND DISMISSED IT AS, AN ASPIRATION. ISRAELIS WERE, WRONG. IN OUR COUNTRY, THE FBI, DIRECTOR TOLD THE SENATE PANEL, JUST YESTERDAY THAT HE SEES,, \"BLINKING RED LIGHTS, EVERYWHERE,\" AND THAT THE, THREAT LEVEL HAD, \"GONE TO A, WHOLE OTHER LEVEL SINCE OCTOBER, OUR COUNTRY DO YOU WORRY COULD, BLIND SIDE US?, >> WHAT WORRIES ME AND WHAT, KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS WHAT, HAPPENS BETWEEN NOW AND, ELECTION DAY WHILE JOE BIDEN IS, ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BUT, I'LL TELL YOU THAT AMERICA, RIGHT NOW IS ACTING LIKE IT'S, SEPTEMBER 10. WE BETTER, REMEMBER WHAT SEPTEMBER 12 FELT, LIKE. WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWING, PEOPLE TO COME IN. IRAN KNOWS, THE EASIEST WAY TO GET TO, AMERICA IS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN, BORDER. WE ARE NOT DOING, ANYTHING TO STOP IT. WE'VE GOT, TO GET THE FOREIGN INFILTRATION, OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WHETHER IT, IS IN OUR SCHOOLS, WHETHER IT, IS IN OUR ESSENTIAL SOCIAL, MEDIA, OR WHETHER IT IS WE NEED, TO STOP ALL FOREIGN LOBBYING, THAT'S HAPPENING TO MEMBERS OF, CONGRESS. WE NEED TO START, SECURING AMERICA AGAIN. UNTIL, WE DO THAT, WE'RE GOING TO BE, AT THREATS. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK, AT IRAN, CHINA, AND THEY WANT, TO DESTROY THE WEST. WE'VE GOT, TO START ACTING STRONG AGAIN,, PROTECTING AMERICANS. RIGHT NOW, AMERICANS DON'T FEEL PROTECTED., WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO, STRENGTHEN IT. JOE BIDEN, CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM., THAT'LL CHANGE ON ELECTION DAY., [ APPLAUSE ], >> GOVERNOR DESANTIS. IF CHINA, INVADES TAIWAN, WOULD YOU SEND, AMERICAN TROOPS AS PRESIDENT, BIDEN HAS SAID HE WOULD DO?, >> WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETER, THAT FROM HAPPENING. THAT'S THE, IMPORTANT THING. WE NEED A, STRATEGY OF DENIAL, SO WE ARE, DETERRING THE AMBITIONS. IT IS, GOING TO WORK. TAIWAN IS AN, ALLY. WE HAVE LONG STANDING, AMERICAN POLICY. AND YOU KNOW, HOW THAT'S DONE, AND WE WILL, FOLLOW THAT. BUT HERE IS THE, THING. TAIWAN IS IMPORTANT NOT, JUST BECAUSE OF SEMICONDUCTORS., IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF CHINA, IS ABLE TO BREAK OUT OF THIS, FIRST ISLAND CHAIN, THEY WILL, BE ABLE TO DOMINATE COMMERCE IN, THE ENTIRE INDO-PACIFIC. THEY, WILL USE THAT TO EXPORT, AUTHORITARIANISM ALL AROUND THE, WORLD INCLUDING HERE IN THE, UNITED STATES. YOU LOOK AT SOME, >>> WELCOME BACK TO THE NEWS, NATION REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, DEBATE HERE IN TUSCALOOSA,, ALABAMA. WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE, FINAL QUESTION BEFORE CLOSING, STATEMENTS. WE WANT TO GET YOU, ALL IN, SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE, YOU 45 SECONDS FOR THIS LAST, ONE. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, WE'RE, GOING TO START WITH YOU. WHICH, FORMER PRESIDENT WOULD YOU DRAW, INSPIRATION FROM FOR YOUR OWN, PRESIDENCY AND WHY?, >> I WOULD DRAW INSPIRATION, FROM RONALD REAGAN. IN THE LAST, YEAR, I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME, WRITING A BOOK ABOUT PRESIDENT, REAGAN THAT WILL BE CALLED WHAT, WILL REAGAN DO? THAT BOOK WILL, COME OUT EARLY IN 2024. WHEN I, LEARNED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, IS THAT RONALD REAGAN WAS A, SLAVE TO THE TRUTH. RONALD, REAGAN STOOD UP FOR THE TRUTH, WHETHER IT WAS POPULAR OR, UNPOPULAR AT THE MOMENT. IN, 1964 HE STOOD UP AGAINST THE, JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY WHEN IT WAS, VERY UNPOPULAR TO THE PARTY TO, DO IT, BUT HE WOULD NOT PUT UP, WITH OUR PARTY STANDING FOR, LIES AND DECEIT EVEN IF IT GAVE, HIM POLITICAL PROGRESS. THAT'S, THE KIND OF PRESIDENT THAT I, WILL BE, AND I WITHDRAW THAT, INSPIRATION FROM THE 40th, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,, RONALD REAGAN., >> AMBASSADOR HALEY?, >> I HAVE TO SAY TOO, GEORGE, WASHINGTON WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE, DO YOU GO AND TAKE ON THIS, GREAT AMERICAN EXPERIMENT? AND, MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE, PROTECTED. THEY ALWAYS KNEW, GOVERNMENT WAS INTENDED TO, SECURE THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OF THE PEOPLE. IT WAS NEVER, MEANT TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL, PEOPLE. THEN YOU LOOK AT, ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND YOU LOOK AT, THE CHALLENGES AND YOU LOOK AT, THE DIVISION THAT HAPPENED IN, OUR COUNTRY AND THE ABILITY TO, LEAD IN SPITE OF THE LOUD, NOISES AND SAY WHAT WILL BRING, OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE TO GET, US TO GO FORWARD IS ALWAYS, SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT. I, THINK WE NEED THAT NOW MORE, THAN EVER. [ APPLAUSE ], >> GOVERNOR DESANTIS?, >> EXCELLENT. ONE OF THE GUYS, I'LL TAKE INSPIRATION FROM IS, CALVIN COOLIDGE. HE'S ONE OF, THE FEW PRESIDENTS THAT GOT, ALMOST EVERYTHING RIGHT. HE, UNDERSTOOD THE PROPER ROLE THE, GOVERNMENT UNDER THE, CONSTITUTION. WE NEED TO, RESTORE THE CONSTITUTION AS THE, CENTER PIECE OF OUR NATIONAL, LIFE. THE ORIGINAL, UNDERSTANDING OF THE, CONSTITUTION WHO HAS A GOOD, SENSE OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS,, AND WHO KNOWS HOW WE HAVE GONE, OFF TRACK WITH THIS MASSIVE, FOURTH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT,, WHICH IS IMPOSING THEIR WILL ON, US AND IT IS BEING WEAPONIZED, AGAINST US. SO SILENT CAL, KNEW, THE PROPER ROLE OF THE FEDERAL, GOVERNMENT AND THE E COUNTRY WAS, IN GREAT SHAPE WHEN HE WAS, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,, AND WE CAN LEARN AN AWFUL LOT, FROM CAL INDIVIDUAL COOLIDGE., >> OVER TO YOU, MR. RAMASWAMY,, TO INCLUDE OUR HISTORY LESSON., >> SURE, I'LL SAY RON PICKED A, PRESIDENT WHO WAS BORN ON JULY, 4. I'LL PICK ONE WHO DIED ON, JULY 4. IT IS THOMAS JEFFERSON., HE WAS 33 YEARS OLD WHEN HE, WROTE THE DECLARATION OF, INDEPENDENCE. YOU ARE ALL, SITTING ON THE SWIVEL CHAIR, TODAY. HE INVENTED THAT SWIVEL, CHAIR WHILE HE WAS AT IT, WHILE, RIDING THAT DECLARATION OF, INDEPENDENCE. THAT'S THE, FOUNDING SPIRIT THAT WE MISSED,, THAT WE'RE THE PIONEERS AND THE, EXPLORERS, THE GUY THAT SENT, THEM OUT. I THINK A LOT OF WHAT, WOULD THOMAS JEFFERSON SAY TO, TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE, ONE THING HE WOULD REMIND US OF, THAT WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT, IT TONIGHT, BUT IT'S ONE OF THE, INTERESTING IDEOLOGICAL, DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING, IN OUR PARTY IS FREEDOM OF, SPEECH. YOU GET TO EXPRESS YOUR, MIND FREELY NO MATTER HOW, HEINOUS THE OPINION IS AS THEY, UNDERSTOOD THAT., >> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, SIR., THANK YOU, MR. RAMASWAMY., BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT'S TIME, FOR CLOSING STATEMENTS., GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, WOULD YOU, >> SURE, THANK YOU. I WANT YOU, ALL TO KIND OF PICTURE IN YOUR, MIND ELECTION DAY. YOU ALL BE, HEADING TO THE POLLS TO VOTE., AND THAT IS SOMETHING DONALD, TRUMP WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO., BECAUSE HE WILL BE CONVICTED OF, FELONIES BEFORE THEN AND HIS, RIGHT TO VOTE WILL BE TAKEN, AWAY. YOU KNOW, LOOK, HERE IS, THE BOTTOM LINE, YOU CAN BOO, ABOUT IT ALL YOU LIKE AND, CONTINUE TO DENY REALITY. BUT, IF WE DENY REALITY AS A PARTY,, WE'LL HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS WITH, JOE BIDEN. MY COLLEAGUES HERE, RAISED THEIR HANDS AND SAID, THEY WOULD SUPPORT HIM EVEN IF, HE WAS A CONVICTED FELON. THE, BIGGER PROBLEM WITH IT IS THEY, WERE CONFIRMING THE LIES HE'S, TOLD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IF, YOU ARE TOO TIMID TO TAKE ON, TRUMP, BELIEVE ME, OTHERS WILL, SEE THAT HUMIDITY. XI, PUTIN,, ANTHE BORDER CROSSERS ON THE, SOUTHERN BORDER, AND THE, CRIMINALS IN OUR STREETS., THEY'LL SENSE THAT AND THEY, WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT, FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP. WE NEED, TO GET BACK TO AN OLD AMERICAN, IDEA THAT EVERY PERSON IS, RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN, CONDUCT EVEN A PRESIDENT. I'LL, BE THE KIND OF PRESIDENT WHO, HAS THE HUMILITY THAT KNOWS YOU, WORK FOR THE PEOPLE. IT'S NOT, THE OTHER WAY AROUND. I WILL, EARN YOUR TRUST. I WANT TO EARN, YOUR VOTE., >> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR, CHRISTIE. MR. RAMASWAMY?, >> I WILL USE THIS TO ADDRESS A, TOPIC NOT ADDRESSED TONIGHT,, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC, THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED., THAT IS THE CLIMATE CHANGE, AGENDA THAT'S SHACKLING THE, COUNTRY LIKE A SET OF, HANDCUFFS. I SAID IT IN THE, FIRST DEBATE AND I STAND BY IT., THE CLIMATE CHANGE AGENDA IS A, HOAX BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO, DO WITH THE CLIMATE. THAT'S, WHAT WE HAVE TO SEE. 98%, REDUCTION IN THE CLIMATE, DISASTER RELATED DEATHS IN THE, LAST CENTURY. EIGHT TIMES AS, MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE OF, COLD TEMPERATURES THIS YEAR, THAN WARM ONES.

WE ARE, FLOGGING OURSELVES, LOSING OUR","shortTranscript":"former president Trump recently promised, if he's reelected to bring back and, expand his program restricting, immigration from Muslim

from those, countries that's the way we should look, at it is which countries are a threat to, us you look at what came across the, southern border what worries me the most, are those that came from

[Applause], [Music], hi and welcome to a special edition of, Banfield I'm Elizabeth Smart in tonight, for Ashley this is an important and, personal hour for me we will be bringing, you terrifying stories of survival, children abducted through no fault of, their own forced to endure things no, child should ever have have to endure, all at the hands of predators who have, chosen to commit heinous crimes and, steal innocence as many of you already, know My Own Story of Survival began in, 2002 when I was only 14 years old, kidnapped from the safest place I could, imagine my bedroom in just a bit I'll, share with you how I survived my own, private Nightmare and how I use every, single day through the Elizabeth Smart, Foundation to try and bring hope to, others who have experienced something, similar my dad Ed smart joins the, conversation too I will also bring you, the incredible story of Tanya cash Tanya, like me was 14 when she was abducted her, captor was a security guard at her, school and he kept her locked in his, bedroom for a decade she couldn't leave, that room even to use the bathroom she, had to use a bucket Tanya will join me, live this hour you might also remember, Charlotte who was just nine when she, vanished while camping with her family, in Upstate New York late last year the, whole country was on pins and needles, hoping and praying as every hour went by, that she would be safely returned she, was rescued roughly 48 hours later we, all know how crucial those first 48, hours are charlet is also a Survivor and, her mother and Aunt are here tonight, it's a busy night night so Ashley thanks, for letting me sit here and let's get, started the night of my own abduction, started off the same way that every, other night went I mean it was a busy, time of year it was the end of the, school year and nothing really set it, apart from any other day I remember we, went through the usual family routine I, remember going to bed I shared a room, with my little sister Mary Katherine we, even shared a bed I remember falling, asleep never, considering that my life could change, and the next thing that I remember was, waking up to a man's voice which at, first I didn't respond because how could, that possibly be happening in my own, bedroom so I just laid there and then, the voice spoke again saying the same, words again saying I have a knife at, your neck don't make a sound get up and, come with me and in those, moments I it felt it felt unreal it felt, like this couldn't actually be happening, except I could feel something cold and, sharp lying across my neck I could feel, someone's hand on my arm trying to pull, me out of bed and I realized that my, nightmares were real they were inside my, bedroom I was taken up into the, mountains by behind my home I mean less, than four miles from my house and I was, brought to this secret hidden campsite, um it was pretty difficult to get to and, almost the first thing that happened to, me was when I got there was I was, stripped and I was forced to put on a, robe and then I was told that I was now, this man's wife which of course I didn't, think Could Happen um I was immediately, raped did not matter how much I I begged, or pleaded and the crazy thing about it, is is that I was kidnapped by a husband, and wife a man and a woman and they, found that the best way to control, people around them was by manipulating, religion, so from day one almost hour one they, were telling me things like I was chosen, that I should be, grateful and um for the next nine months, that's how they Justified everything, they did to me during that time period, and sometimes it was really hard it made, I wouldn't say I ever fully lost hope, but there were some pretty low times I, mean I was raped daily often multiple, times I mean I was withheld food I was, was withheld with water was withheld, from me um there were a lot of times, that I really wondered if I would just, die naturally because I hope seem so dim, of me being rescued but during those, nine months um my captors took me to, California for the winter miraculously I, was able to convince them to return to, Utah which we hit hitched hike back to, Utah that was a whole Adventure um but, we were walking up State Street in Salt, Lake with on the first day that we were, back in Utah when all of a sudden a, police car pulled up and another one and, another one and I don't even remember, how many officers jumped out of the car, but they ran over and started asking, questions and initially I was too scared, to respond and it wasn't until they, separated me from my captor that I was, finally able to admit who I was I, remember being brought to the police, station where I was held in a small room, and I I really didn't know um what was, going on but I remember my dad walking, into the room well more like running, into the room more like just appearing, into the room really and he came over, and he just picked me up in the biggest, hug and I remember for the first time in, nine months that's when I felt safe was, when my dad was finally hugging me, because I knew that no matter what the, future held it was going to be okay, because he was going to be there and he, was going to protect me and no one would, ever be able to hurt me ever again the, way that these two people had hurt me, the last nine months now my story, doesn't end there I mean my story is, still being written today but certainly, between then and now there's been many, ups and downs and certainly one of those, roller coasters uh was the whole Justice, uh system that we went through the trial, and that was that was hard and I think, you could ask any Survivor and ask them, do you feel like justice was truly, served and I don't think anyone would, say yes because even though my case is, so rare in that it was successfully proc, cuted I didn't get my childhood back, those nine months that were taken from, me weren't given back so I feel, incredibly grateful that um my case my, captors were prosecuted that um Brian, Mitchell will never be released from, prison he'll never be able to hurt, anyone ever again um but even more than, that I'm just so grateful now that I, have the family that I have today and, joining me now is my dad, edmart um my dad is one of the most, special people to me in the world and he, has been a mentor and an exampler and, someone that I have wanted to emulate my, entire life who has always put his his, needs aside and tried to do what is, right for the world around him and so, Dad thanks so much for joining me, tonight um pleas one of the questions I, was one of the questions I was kind of, worried about is before my kidnapping, did you do you remember hearing of other, kidnapping stories did you did you, follow was that was that something that, was even on your, radar no I I don't think that most, people feel that there is the, possibility that that's ever going to, happen to them and that's certainly you, know the case in in your abduction uh, you know when Mary Katherine came into, the room and said Dad I think somebody, has taken Elizabeth with my first, thought was you know you're just having, a bad nightmare just calm down and um, we'll get it taken care of so you know I, got up and checked and went into your, room and of course you weren't there and, I started going from room to room and as, I came downstairs and your mother had uh, you know just followed me down and Mary, Katherine once again had said you know, you're not going to find her a man has, taken her and I think it was at that, point the reality started sinking in, that something actually had happened so, for any parent out there, who who probably thinks that it can, never happen to me that's how we felt, and uh I certainly felt like there was, the possibility that um you know you, were just hiding somewhere or you were, downstairs or in one of the other kids', rooms but that was not the case and is, that reality sunk home the um the depth, of the craziness of the whole abduction, started hitting home and it you know it, certainly hit home for your mother and I, I don't think I've ever seen her in such, pain as I did going into our living room, and sitting down on the sofa and just, going into this, uh probably a mode that you were, currently in at that same time, unbelievable I can't even imagine now as, a parent myself like I can't even, imagine how I would feel if I found out, that one of one of my kids was kidna, today I think and I'm curious to know I, mean how how did you know what to do how, did you keep my story in the media I, mean I look back and I think it played, such a role in bringing me home keeping, my name out there how did you how were, you able to Captivate the media's, attention to cover my story as much as, you did, well I think that one of the things that, happened in your case you were the first, what we called Rachel Alert in Utah, which was the amber alert and in so, doing that brought a fair amount of, publicity and the push to basically make, the entire uh National AMBER Alert, available to all victims because I think, it's one of the first lines of defense, that any parent has to be able to, basically tap into all of the the people, that are around you and the the whole, nation to bring an awareness to the the, child being missing is huge so you know, to us um we were constantly looking and, we knew that one of the things that we, had to do was one to stay out there in, front of the news to try to tell new, stories about you have new pictures, bring new videos and of course it was, just the beginning, of the internet and the web and that, just became huge and is even bigger, today because um when you think about, trying to find find you I mean that was, our goal and the police to them it was a, matter of eliminating everyone, eliminating other possibilities to try, to get down to you know what actually, happened to you so I think, that um being able to call on all of the, people out in the in our neighborhood in, Utah and across the nation was huge in, in bringing you, back and I think it's really important, um for parents to hear how do you best, interact with law enforcement I mean, it's usually their job to look at the, people are most likely and usually they, do look at the families first what is, your what is your advice to parents who, are in that situation and working with, law enforcement, I think a lot has happened since the, time you were abducted uh the cart, team's child abduction response teams, have uh come into play and that is a, huge thing I mean one of the biggest, frustrations was to see all the, different law enforcement agencies out, there and not see them coordinated, together uh I remember one of my good, friends Corey Lyman saying Ed you know I, know you're not going to believe this, but uh we have never worked so well, together and that was very frustrating, because you know you hope that when a, child goes missing everyone puts aside, their egos and it's not about who found, you but did we find you and and that's, what happened in the end um and I think, the coordinated effort of so many law, enforcement agencies now makes a huge, difference and when you take that along, with um empowering the public to come on, board to try and help find a child it, allows um allows so much more, information to flow especially with the, internet you know people that have seen, things people that uh might know, something uh they feel more open to be, able to say it without revealing, themselves so that's good and bad uh you, know we had so many people that that, were kind of crazy that you know thought, they knew I remember the second day, that you were missing uh one of the, police officers came up and said uh you, know this woman down here down the steps, claims that uh you know you've walled, Elizabeth up in the house and I said you, know please come in please find her you, know there wasn't anything that we, weren't willing to do and being willing, to cooperate with law enforcement is, huge um to make them part of your team, and trying to find your child, is so important you know there are all, sorts of obstacles that come out I think, you're I think you're so like I think, you're so right the focus does need to, stay on on the child I guess for my, final question and in like 20 seconds, what would you say to the families who, still have missing children who are, trying to maintain, hope you know you can't give up hope, until there's a body and I think that, you know certainly I had an impression, that you were still out there that we, couldn't give up and that uh that there, was no way we would let ourselves go to, that point and so for every parent out, there I think you know keeping your, child's face out there being able to you, know share new information about your, child to engage the public um that's, really what it's all about is engaging, the public so that was that's the most, important way whether it's through the, internet through the news uh through, media well Dad thank you so much for, joining me that's edmart my dad and, still to come a major Breakin A murder, case that made headlines across the, country Rachel Moren a mother of five, was jogging and was killed in August of, last year tonight police have a suspect, in custody who they believe has murdered, people in multiple countries the details, next, [Music], for months police believe Rachel moren's, murder may be connected to a previous, assault in Los Angeles but now it also, appears to be part of an even bigger and, international crime spree Moren a mother, of five was found murdered near a hiking, trail in Maryland in August of, 2023 on Friday police arrested Victor, Antonio Martinez Hernandez a 23-year-old, citizen of El Salvador who crossed into, the United States illegally in February, of last year he's charged with, first-degree murder and first-degree, rape in moren's case they caught him, using DNA in November authorities linked, the Moren case to a brutal assault in, Los Angeles of a 99-year-old girl and, her mother after that assault the, suspect was caught on this surveillance, video and in in February investigators, released these police sketches the FBI, later used genealogy testing to match, the suspects DNA to potential family, members living in El Salvador who I, identified him authorities in El, Salvador say he also murdered a young, woman there in January 2023 then fled to, the US in February that means he, allegedly murdered a woman in El, Salvador assaulted a 99-year-old girl, and her mother in Los Angeles and, murdered Rachel Moren in Maryland before, police caught up with him in Tulsa, Oklahoma I'm joined Now by Rachel, moren's brother Michael Moren and the, family's attorney Randolph rice Michael, what's your reaction to the arrest do, you feel like you have the closure you, need or that guilty verdict how are you, feeling I mean initially when I heard, the news I was elated um you know I was, just so thankful is an answer to you, know months of prayers um so yeah just, very grateful uh that he's caught right, now and I know it's just the next stage, uh this process and it's going to be a, long road going forward um but right now, I'm just uh you know very grateful uh, you know answer to, prayer Michael the suspect is being, extracted to Harford County Maryland now, will he be tried for Rachel's murder do, you know, um yeah I spoke with uh investigators, and I believe um you know that's my, understanding is that um he's going to, be tried for murder of murder and rape, my sister uh before any other, charges I think it's easy when we listen, to the news to just think that these, stories are are far away or just just to, think of them as stories but you're a, real person Rachel was a real person she, left behind a family how are all of you, doing, today um I mean I think we're all, grieving a little, different um you know uh but it's the, hardest for the five children um so, family's spending a lot of time with, them and um you know just being there, for, them I I just I want you to know, personally I, mean I just send all my thoughts and all, my prayers to you and your entire family, I have not experienced murder but I did, experience having my family ripped away, from you and I know how devastating that, can be and wondering if you'll ever see, them again so please know that I will, continue to keep you and all of your, family in my thoughts um Rand Randolph, sorry 10 months after Rachel's murder, are you surprised it's taken so long to, identify the, suspect early on we thought that it did, take a little bit longer than than, expected uh when you have a DNA hit and, you have a doorbell camera then, ultimately the sketch you would think in, most cases it's a slam dunk but the, problem was they didn't have a name to, link that DNA profile but I got to tell, you the detective in the Harper County, Sheriff Department the FBI they kept, with the facts they kept the case and, they push forward and really they're the, ones to thank for this capture of this, suspect because they did the hard work, they were patient uh and they and they, ended on a high note with catching this, individual in Tulsa, Oklahoma do you feel like testing the, DNA should have been maybe like the, first thing they did and using the, genealogy well they did that they did, obtain that DNA result but the genealogy, does take time and that was something, that were saying along the way that look, it just takes time to work through the, genealogy it's not an overnight process, like a DNA test to match so we, understand obviously 10 months is seems, like forever and I'm sure Michael can, say that it's been an agonizing 10, months but there is a little bit of Hope, obviously that that he's been captured, he'll be brought back to Maryland within, the next week or two he'll be go before, that the case will go before grand jury, where he will no doubtly be uh indicted, he'll be held without bail and ultim, have to make make the decision is to, take a plea in this case or go to trial, that's something that we'll find out in, the, future do you know or have you heard if, anyone was helping him hide during this, whole 10-month search for him the, sheriff's department has indicated that, there was a connection through some, gangs uh there are some known gangs uh, in in America from that region um that, was one of the ways he was able to, travel around the country as a belief, that the sheriff's department does have, um so I think all that will come out as, they do more investigation and this is, important that we're still talking about, this case because there are still facts, they're collecting there's still, evidence they're collecting they want to, put together a profile and a picture as, to how this man came from El Salvador, and made to, Maryland do you think there are more, victims out, there I I believe there are and here's, why we've got a time frame or difference, between March of 2023 and r death in, August of 23 and then August up until, the day he was captured this past Friday, a man who kills in El Salvador attacks, in Los Angeles kills in Maryland there, has to be more victims out there we're, hoping those victims come forward, hopefully they feel safe now because, this man is captured that he can cause, no harm to them that they're willing to, come forward and also that other people, have come forward to make a timeline to, put more evidence together as to how he, got to where he got how he got to, Maryland uh in August of 23 to to to, take Rachel's life on that, trail well like you said I think it is, so important to keep having this, conversation and reminding people if, they have any information if they know, any more victims please come forward so, Michael Moren and Randolph rice thank, you still to come kidnapping isn't, always something that happens in a busy, crowd or in the middle of the night it, can be gradual where the offender slowly, builds a relationship with a vulnerable, child over time after the break you'll, meet a woman who like me was kidnapped, at the age of 14 but not by a stranger, it was by someone who worked at her, middle school and who held her captive, for a decade her Story of Survival and, courage is, [Music], [Applause], next in 1996 Tanya cash was in the e8th, grade at Cornell Middle School in mck, sport Pennsylvania, but instead of living a Carefree life of, 14-year-old she was dealing with a, chaotic home life of ab of abuse and, neglect with parents in the middle of a, messy divorce at school she forged an, odd friendship with a 30 38-year-old, security guard named Tom hose he, listened to her problems made her laugh, and showered her with gifts these were, all steps in the grooming process then, there was relationship took a dark turn, hose forced her into his elderly, parents' home where he lived and held, her for a decade locked in his bedroom, he sexually abused and tortured her at, will in 2006 at age 24 Tanya Found the, courage to escape when hose allowed her, to work a part-time job convenience, store T's Story of Survival is so, powerful and important I helped produce, a life time film about it called the, girl locked upstairs the Tanya cash, story take a, look I heard what you said about me I, swear I wouldn't do that stop lying not, hey clear out of here Stephanie darlot, principal now is everyone here so mean, we're friends aren't we you're my only, friend you T and do anything T what are, you doing here I can't stay at home my, mom turned me away that's why I need to, stay someplace else no one can know, you're here okay this is the only way, you can be safe don't make any noise, this isn't going to be forever I, promise you've got to take control of, your life it's not my life what excuse, do you think you could have for breaking, my, rules I can't go on like, this I'm joined Now by my friend and, someone I greatly admire Tanya cash, Tanya it's been 18 years since you, courageously escaped do you look back at, it and wonder how you did it how did you, survive it I mean more than a, decade I know I I look back and I I, wonder how I survived it I it's, crazy, crazy but by the grace of God, it no you're just such an incredible, woman you are so strong I mean you kept, going, every single day um your story it, shows and teaches so much about grooming, and mental control and I mean what in, your words do you feel like are signs, that parents and friends should watch, for uh they need to watch for the signs, where you know if an adult who what, happened to me was he was 38 and I'm 14, and sitting down talking and having a, conversation and he gave me jewelry he, gave me money you know he gave me, cigarettes he gave me things that I I, had you know that a 38- year old man, should not have been giving a, 14-year-old girl and that's one of the, ways of you know one of the big ways of, grooming and how that came about and and, everything but I I mean you're so right, right we all need to pay attention to, the relationships around us and know, when something's different or not right, when there is extra attention being a p, paid to someone that probably shouldn't, be paid to um you also feel your story, helps women in abusive relationships um, how so there you know women, unfortunately in abusive relationships, it's it's a cycle and they do things to, keep them in the relationship you know, they they buy them things they apologize, for the abuse and it's an it's a, NeverEnding cycle and I'm hoping by, women seeing my story to break that, cycle and to get, out I think you're right and we chatted, before that I mean we both experience, that control over us to the point that I, mean I can say that I know that those, mental bonds are stronger than physical, bonds I mean I experienced them both and, it becomes I mean your captors these and, what I imagine domestic violence um, abuse victims experience is that the, other person just becomes so powerful, they feel, like that they're Invincible that you no, one can protect you from them I mean is, that do you feel like that's how you, felt as, well oh that's exactly how I felt you, know with the mental control like he was, in charge he was in control I did what, he told me to do when where how you know, he told me to jump it was how, high I mean I think I just know that, your story is so powerful and so many, people still need to hear it because it, does show it does show what grooming, looks like it does show how d ous these, situations can be how easy it is for a, vulnerable child to be targeted um and, now you have a beautiful life and can, you just tell me how do you feel about, life now I mean what what does your life, look like where does your strength keep, coming, from oh my, strength you know I have to say my, strength comes from my husband is my, rock now you know I I found true love, and what love is just like with you as, well you know and he he keeps me going, you know I mean he is always encouraging, me and giving me support and it's so, wonderful and life now is great you know, I he has I have stepchildren of his and, then I have grandchildren through my, stepson so you know I have a busy life, of of being a, grandmother I think having a supportive, family and a supportive Network around, you really does make all the difference, as to whether you come back and you, reclaim your life and you thrive and, you're happy, versus sort of the the opposite end of, the spectrum the negative cycle downward, cycle that can happen um so my last, question for you Tanya is to anyone who, is watching this or anyone who watches, your story or hears about it and they, find themselves in a similar situation, what would your words of encouragement, or advice be to, them that you know I how I explained all, of the red flags and everything and you, know for to keep an a mindful watch out, for those things and control and you, know be careful if there's any isolation, as well because that is something that, you know happens in an abusive, relationship will is the isolation to, stay to only him you know that, person so you know by my story you know, I I want them to break free of that and, to get out of, that well Tanya you are amazing and I I, adore you so thank you for joining me, tonight, and and Ashley if you're watching, another big thank you for letting me sit, in tonight still to come so how does a, little girl even start to heal and live, a normal life again after kidnapping, some victims of that life shattering, crime are throwing off the word and, choosing Survivor instead joining me, next the mother and Aunt of 9-year-old, Survivor just months after her ordeal in, Upstate New York they joined me live, right here, next exploring ways to treat even more, types of cancer it's true Kuda from Merk, see all the types of cancer Kuda is, known for at kit.com and ask your doctor, if Kuda could be right for, [Music], you it's not even been N9 months since a, family in Upstate New York experienced, the same terrifying moment that hit my, family more than 20 years ago their, little girl a 9-year-old named Charlotte, had simply disappeared from their, camping trip Charlotte's family didn't, know it yet but she'd been abducted and, locked inside a camper after about 48, Hours police managed to track down where, Charlotte was being held and they set, her free her kidnapper and as salent, pleaded guilty and is in prison, hopefully until he dies but tonight is, not about that case or that, investigation tonight is about Charlotte, and her survival and her healing joining, me live in the news Nation Studio Trisha, Senna charlot's mother and Jana Lani, Senna Charlotte's Aunt they are not only, helping navigate Charlotte's recovery, and life after this nightmare but they, are sharing their story with the world, on the podcast Sisterhood of the, survivors available on all the major, podcast sites so thank you first of all, both of you ladies for joining me and I, love your shirts you say with no fear I, love that how did you come up with that, what does that what does that symbolize, and embody to you so when Charlotte, wrote her impact statement she signed it, with uh with no fear Kama, Charlotte so she was really making a, point, yeah and I think she's living her life, that way too since this happened so even, like I know that this is not super, comfortable of an experience for Trisha, because she doesn't work in TV like I do, but she looks at Charlotte as an, inspiration and as an example that she, can do hard things y because we have a, purpose with this, so I think that just speaks so much to, who she is and even today I mean my, first question was going to be how is, Charlotte today but that almost feels, redundant cuz cuz you're saying that's, how she signed her Victim Impact, statement I mean how how amazing that's, incredible I mean so you've come out, really strongly that she is a Survivor, and not a victim and I just want to hear, you explain in your words what do you, feel like the difference is between a, victim and a Survivor so when I hear the, word victim it feels it feels harsh and, it, feels hard and just sad like usually, when you hear victim you feel sadness, and empathy and I really want Charlotte, to be seen as a Survivor for one because, she works really really hard to be a, Survivor every day and just like think, about how we talk about people who, overcome anything really difficult in, life like cancer for example we say, they're a cancer survivor and the and, Charlotte is a survivor of a really um, terrible experience but she she is, surviving she's working hard every day, and her I'm going to follow her her, motto here without fear that's what, she's doing she's taking this and she's, saying this is not going to Define me, I'm a, Survivor I love that and I think you're, I think you're exactly right um I think, I think that is what sets, survivors um that's what makes a, Survivor is that mental mindset of I'm, not going to let this ruin my life I'm, not going to let I'm not not going to, allow fear to stop me from doing what I, want to do and I guess in that same vein, would you say that that's how she's, living her life I mean does she have, normal 9-year-old summer plans of course, of course she does yes she she came home, and she was looked at me like right away, and she said I just decided this is not, going to ruin my life and I'm just going, to move forward and that was like 2, hours after being home so she has always, made this really conscious decision that, this wasn't defining her and she was, moving forward and she's doing hard, things and thinks out of her comfort, zone so like this summer she's doing a, play and I think it's just because she, now feels like I can do this I can do, hard things I can be brave I overcome, something that was really scary and, tragic and now I'm I'm G to go do things, and step out of my home like I said, she's doing a play um which for anybody, that knows her it's like really, mind-blowing to think that she's going, to do this but she's doing it she's own, it she's loving, it I mean I just think that that speaks, so much to the kind of family that you, are I mean I know I have a 9-year-old, daughter myself and and I I try to tell, her all the time you can do hard things, you're so strong you can do hard things, and just what you've said about how she, just immediately came out and was like, I'm not a victim I'm a survivor I'm not, going to live in fear this isn't going, to Define me kind of thing I mean that's, everything that I want for my own child, and I hope that's how she would respond, I just think that just that just speaks, to the family that that you are and and, this incredible young woman that you're, raising um on a little bit maybe of a, more difficult Direction how does, Charlotte process what is happened to, her I mean does she does she talk about, it or is that something that she Cho, ches not to does she want focus on the, here and now or does she find it helpful, to um revisit the past and work through, everything that happened, so the way trauma works is it's going to, take your experience and it literally, just smashes it into a million pieces, and it'll come back to you when you're, ready for it to come back to you so, sometimes our conversations are every, single night and sometimes they are you, know a week in between um but I am a, huge advocate of talking about our, feelings and talking through things like, I tell Charlotte all the time you have, to pull the weeds so the flowers can, grow and her weeds are her fears the, things that she's afraid of or you know, just things creeping in after you know, months of that her not thinking of them, it's like you got to get them out you, got to talk about it and I feel that's, really important for healing um so so, talking is a big big part of our our, days and just trying to get as much of, that out as we, can speaking of talking tell me about, The Sisterhood of um tell me about the, podcast The Sisterhood of the survivors, it's it's not only Charlotte's story but, your whole families tell me about it, well I think the ripple effect and you, probably know this Elizabeth firsthand, but the ripple effect of something like, this on families is huge huge so it's, like everybody's experiencing their own, trauma and experiencing their own you, know stuff with this and on top of it, with such a high-profile case we're, getting like inundated with the stories, so just a quick note on the whole victim, and Survivor thing we know that one day, she's going to Google Google her name, and we wanted her to have these stories, come up about all the good that her, family is doing good that has you know, kind of come out of this the activism, that sort of thing as opposed to the, stories that are her being this person's, victim so that was really important to, us so we were kind of like talking every, day pretty much talking about different, things that we could do moving forward, and we one day were like you know should, we start speaking out more about this, and we were working um talking with Nick, Mick National Center for missing and, exploited children and I wrote a Blog, for them and we were trying to figure, out um different things that we could do, to you know use this kind of new, platform and um Trisha said why don't we, make our own platform and so that's how, the podcast idea kind of was born and in, a way it's really just letting people in, on the conversations that we've been, having already for the past almost 9, months um but we also I think that is, yes we also plan to bring people on too, so amazing it's not just us talking so, amazing and and may every Survivor have, as supportive a family as Charlotte does, thank you Trisha Senna and Jana Lani, Senna still to come it's been 21 years, since I was rescued from my kidnappers, and now as a mother of three there are, practices I have in place to keep my, children safe from what I faced and you, can too and when we come back the three, things you need your child to know no, matter what their age don't go, anywhere the three things that I want my, children to know no matter what is, number one I love them unconditionally, there isn't anything that they could, ever do that would make me stop loving, them the second thing that I want them, to know is that heaven forbid anything, ever happens to them but if it does it, is not their fault they didn't do, anything wrong and the third thing I, want them to know is that they can come, to me and ask for the bubble of safety, which is where they can tell me anything, they need to and I won't respond, emotionally for 24 hours I will focus on, helping them to get through whatever, they need and mentoring them and be the, best support that I can be those are my, three those are my three points of, advice and so please remember them and, I'll be back tomorrow night and make, sure you stay tuned for Chris Cuomo, next thank, [Music], Chris foro here thank you for the, company I hope Daddy Day made good, memories if I sound sick it is because I, am and I'll get to that in a bit but let, me set the table by calling something, out have you realized

kidnapping did you do you, remember hearing of other kidnapping, stories no I I don't think that most, people feel that there is the, possibility that that's ever going to, happen to them you know

we probably have a, lot of disagreements on uh what is going, over uh in the Middle East but if we can, get clarity I think this podcast of, where those differences are I think that, this podcast will will be worth it um, let me just Begin by asking you uh if, Medi Hassan was prime minister of Israel, on October 7th how he would he have, responded to the attacks so I was lost, question before recently on another show, and I'll say the same thing first of all, that I told the other interviewer which, is if I was Benjamin Netanyahu on, October the 7 and saw that horror go out, on my watch with no military there in, time with a group that I'd helped prop, up for years I'd have quit I'd have had, some self-respect that had some, shame and my first reaction as prime, minister of Israel would to no longer be, prime minister of Israel I would have, quit so that's my first answer but let's, just get to your question because I know, you're actually asking about what should, Israel's response have been um you know, there's that old famous line you know uh, is how do you get from here to there and, I wouldn't have started from here so, first of all I wouldn't want to be the, Israeli government on October the 7th, because I probably wouldn't have allowed, to get to this point right if I had done, the right thing because I believe there, should have been peace and Justice in, the Middle East which is the best way of, avoiding violence but look does Israel, uh go after the people who did this sure, I think it would be very hard for people, to object to that even the most hardcore, suppor of the pales would say it's not, surprising that the Israeli government, wants to capture kill detain the people, who massacred hundreds of their own, civilians that's not what Israel did, though remember the first thing they did, Jamie was to say we're cutting off all, electricity water power that was Gallant, that was cats that was the instant, responses on the 8th nth of October and, then it only got worse since then I, think look we can talk about October the, 7th and we should what happened October, 7th was was a tragedy it was horrific it, was it was pure Terror in the literal, sense of that word, especially when you watch some of the, footage but we are nearly six months on, from then and I don't think you can, still wave around October 7 there's any, kind of explanation justification or, context for what we are seeing right now, in Gaza where we are literally starving, people to death M if your your starting, point is that Israel had the right to go, after Hamas um yeah I I I get, uncomfortable with words like right but, yes it's the natural thing that any, government would have done after being, attacked well well let me just pause, there for a second um do you think Hamas, leaders should be killed are are they a, type of threat that needs to be, eliminated I I'm not a fan of killing, people Jamie so I'll take the same, position I took on Bin Laden I would, like to see people put on trial and, tried in court I would like to have seen, Osama Bin Laden tried and put in prison, uh for what he did I didn't support the, raid that Obama did then uh I'm not a, fan of targeted killings because they, tend not to be targeted there tends to, be collateral damage you often get the, wrong person and it's not a form of, Justice I prefer I know you know I know, in our in our in our lust for vengeance, understandable lust for vengeance people, support this stuff I don't I try and, have a consistent moral worldview I, don't support the death penalty here in, the United States so I think people who, commit horrible crimes should be, captured tried sent to prison that's, what I think should happen and I think, people who have committed war crimes, whether in Gaza or in Israel should be, tried at the international criminal, court I favor the ICC investigating both, sides and holding people to account and, putting out arrest warrants for anyone, who's found if you don't found the, enough evidence that they've committed, war crimes I believe both sides have, committed war crimes well this is, interesting Med because I think we're, getting into Clarity much quicker than I, imagined um if if you opposed the bin, Laden raid uh which was very targeted um, and you do believe Israel has the right, to go after Hamas which hides within, civilian populations and in, tunnels I'm I'm I'm kind of confused, exactly what you would have supported or, what you would have done that would have, aligned to what what you're saying that, you think Israel if not has the right, actually do let's do even more clarity, Jamie I love this word let's get even, clearer couple of things number one the, bin Laden raid since since you you want, to revisit the targeting the issue about, bad is not whether it was Target on the, issue is does the United States have the, right to go around the world killing its, enemies I'm in favor of that if everyone, else has that right Jamie there are a, bunch of Cuban there are a bunch of, Cubans who are accused of carrying out, horrible Crim crimes against Cuba, against civilian airliners living in, Florida do you support the Cuban, government's right to go in in the, middle of the night and kill them, because if you don't then you're not, being morally consistent so I'm in favor, of if everyone has the right to kill, people abroad then fine or nobody not, the US doesn't get a special exception, that's my position in terms of, international law and just basic common, sense and, morality two on theic but do you think, all governments are equal equal morally, I think interal I think international, law treats all governments equally if, you don't follow international law which, is what's happening for the last 6, months we're tearing up the post 1945, settlement that we all agreed on global, South and West then you have the law of, the Jungle the law of the fittest the, strongest there's no way you can stop, Russia from Putin from assassinating his, enemies because he has the power to do, it either you have laws that bind, everyone dictatorships and democracies, or you say might is right and I prefer, the first world view they're both, horrible but I think the first worldview, is the lesser of two evils just on Hamas, look I'm not military strategist Jamie, if you want me to lay out exactly what, special forces raids would have been, involved to get Yahya sinoa and others I, can't answer you what I can say is the, burden is actually not on me to come up, with a strategy for Israel to capture or, kill the leaders of Hamas the burden is, on Israel to follow international law, and let's get some clarity I think we, can both agree they haven't been, following international law for the past, six months they've been indiscriminately, killing people they have been violating, all sorts of uh International laws, Geneva conventions basic rules on, proportionality the UK government run by, conservatives allies of Israel is now, saying that they are in breach of, international law the head of the, conservative Foreign Relations Committee, of the United Kingdom not a lefty Dove, is saying we can no longer sell weapons, to Israel so it's not controversial here, that Israel is at best probably, violating international law in my view, definitely so my position Jamie, therefore is actually I don't need to, come up with what the Israeli strategy, should have been I only need to see that, whatever Israel did had to be in, accordance with international law and, what they've done is not and they, haven't gone after Hamas Jamie they've, killed innocent people they've killed, kids they've killed people who had, nothing to do with Hamas they've killed, people carrying White Flags grandmother, who had nothing to do with Hamas, carrying a white flag with her, grandchild, killed we're gonna, get, we we're gonna get into the numbers um, and uh just for the record I I don't, agree with you I gave specific cases of, people we saw on camera undeniable I I, want to uh I do disagree with you own, international law I don't want to get, bogged down there both in the, application with Israel and what, international law is, quickly I'm fine for us to disagree on, international law but you don't disagree, that the majority of the world right now, thinks Israel is violating the British, government is not a lefty you know, African you know anti-colonial, government it's a conservative, government that says right now that, Britain is violating International, Israel is you acknowledge that I, acknowledge the world has generally not, been favorable to Israel but so if that, if that if that's what you're saying I, acknowledge the un uh UK the UK, government David Cameron David Cameron, is a longstanding supporter of, I don't I don't want to get bogged, bogged down on that if if that's what I, haven't seen a statement if that's what, he says that's what he says I I don't, it's what his foreign Ministry has given, legal advice sure um what what do you so, I guess I want to go back to this here I, I guess you say you're not a military, strategist I've heard this before in, arguments um Israel has the right to go, after Hamas uh but Hamas has made it, they didn't say Israel had the right to, go after Hamas as it's understandable, any government understandable, understandable you don't you don't, believe uh in in in they have the right, but it was understandable why government, would do that but I don't believe it or, not we have to again Clarity what are, our terms right where for example they, don't have the right to go into you know, occupiers have limited rights and, occupied territory Jamie as you know but, but if Hamas has deliberately embedded, itself uh in tunnels underground where, it's very difficult to get what what, prevents what does deliberately embedded, mean since we're thinking terms I don't, I always hear this phrase deliberately, embedded what does that mean to you it, means that they, intentionally created a large tunnel, system under civilian areas and they, often hide weapons in civilian targets, but I don't support them doing that but, I just have a question where should they, be if they shouldn't be in the tunnels, where should they be in your view well I, would say that you probably shouldn't, put it uh tunnels under a hospital uh if, you don't want the hospital to become a, military Target but but but Med where, should they put the tunnel no I just, need to be clear because you said they, deliberately ined you said this is about, Clarity I just need to be clear I don't, think they should any think I think they, should use them in Gaza because there's, civilians everywhere in Gaza do you want, them to stand in a football field in an, open space and say we're over here no I, I think they should have used the money, to create prosperity in Gaza agree on, that I'm asking right now you say, deliberately embedded what's the, alternative to deliberately embed so so, so this interview so let me ask you, under your standard under under your, standard if China uh you know made a, warship and called it a hospital put, some uh civilians there and they went to, go to Taiwan uh after Taiwan I mean, Taiwan should just surrender because, there's no way for them to attack these, warships that they're being called, hospitals uh without in your view, violating international law I mean it's, a crap analogy Jamie with respect, nobody's nobody's claiming that Hamas, built hospitals as warships the argument, is are they using hospitals to hide in, or hide under nobody disputes those are, hospitals have you been to those, hospitals my friend just came back from, a hospital in Gaza he saw kids being, brought in with gunshot Woods to their, head he saw people having operations, with anesthetic the who has pointed out, that the vast majority of healthcare, facilities in Gaza have been damaged or, destroyed dozens of American and, Canadian and British doctors have gone, out white people Jamie not just Brown, Muslims have gone out there and come, back and, said we're not gonna We're Not Gonna, We're not gonna play the race game there, let me finish said then you come back in, they've all gone out and said hospitals, Healthcare facilities have been, destroyed have been damaged for you to, claim that Hamas built a hospital, pretending it's a military base is an, absurd analogy your China analog is one, the worst ever I said I said they built, it under hospitals no you, didn't we can play the takeback you said, China builds this warship calls it a, hospital that is not what anyone has, said Hamas has done in Gaza no one says, Hamas built a hospital and pretended it, was a military base pretending it was a, hospital no one's claimed that not even, the Israelis your analogy doesn't work, sorry to think it does it doesn't make a, difference if if if the warship if the, warship okay if the warship was a, hospital you're saying that there there, there's no, right doesn't work there's not habas, military base masquera as a hospital, just just not yeah well I think it does, but let's continue on um even even the, Washington Post did an investigation of, shiffer and found no bunker I've seen, the video have you seen the video the, Benjamin netan put out the bond villain, lir and Al Sher have we found that yet, they five months we found they just did, two two we operation in sh by the way, after they cleared it a few months ago, by after they cleared it a few months, ago operation that was who was fighting, in that operation who was fighting, against the Israelis to be honest we, don't know Israelis said they killed, naftali Bennett said they killed not a, single civilian and yet we've seen, dozens of bodies including children have, you seen the, footage but medy you just admitted there, was a two- we fight against, she clear have we found the base the, command and control HQ under shiffer, that Benjamin net tweeted a video of did, you see the video we can play the video, if you have it seen a video it looks, like a bond it's very military base that, would be equivalent to your China, analogy found it the Israelis Li you, believe who do you think was fighting, the Israelis for two weeks in alifa, hospital this is again not not the first, fight there the second fight yeah who do, you think was fighting the Israelis for, two weeks in alifa, hospital I'm assuming if they're, claiming they were fighting militants, those would have been Hamas militants, but why would I believe anything the, Israelis say unlike you I I learned my, lesson if the Israelis lie every time, you're not going to believe them by the, way they told us Hamas was gone from the, hospital but now Hamas is back make your, mind up Jamie well I'm confused why that, would be confusing so they might have, removed the hospital a month or two ago, how is Hamas back at the hospital I, thought we we' got rid of, themal I would say that would be a, failure in war if that if if if once you, clear it they come back isra's failing, in its War at least we can find some, agreement no well that would be that, would be a failure not to control the, territory and and have them come back, but I think we now agree that Hamas, milit, in at least the Second Battle hold on, let's just be clear I've never disputed, that Hamas militants May and probably, did use civilian areas to fight from, that's why I think Hamas should be, investigated for war crimes by the IC, like the Israelis that doesn't justify, the wholesale destruction of gaza's, healthc care sector the targeting of, doctors and nurses people in doctor's, jackets being shot by snipers I don't, think snipers get to shoot doctors and, nurs I uh I I don't we're going to, disagree on whether that happens or, not people go on and search let let me, uh the testimony because it's not, convenient but that's let's go to the, numbers medy um you've tweeted several, times uh about the death toll in Gaza, January 24th as an example it would have, cost Biden nothing whatsoever to mention, the 24,000 Palestinian dead even in, passing February 5th uh they were unable, to kill Hamas leadership in the first, four months of the war but managed to, kill 25,000 Palestinians Gaza uh he, Biden says and this is February 22nd he, isn't mincing words and then goes on to, ignore the fact that it's Israel that, has killed 28,000 plus Palestinian, American bombs I'm not asking you about, the accuracy of the numbers or the, composition of the numbers but isn't it, propagandistic to put out those numbers, and not mention that at least thousands, of those numbers are homas, Fighters so it's interesting you should, say that let me just do a nice Shameless, plug for Zeto which is a New Media, company that I'm currently launching, right now um and if the dispatch viewers, and listeners want to check it out z.com, Shameless plug over foro actually wrote, a piece last week Jamie pointing out, that Netanyahu says Benjamin Netanyahu, told build that he believes 13,000 Hamas, terrorists have been killed I don't, believe that number for a second but, that's netanyahu's number right and he, believes that the Israelis have a one to, one and a half ratio of killing civilian, to combatant which he's very proud of if, we take those numbers at face value, which I don't but just for the sake of, argument let's say he's right that means, that between 13,000 and 19 and a half, thousand civilians have been killed in, five months those are shockingly high, numbers and they're not that far off, from the numbers that the Palestinian, Health Ministry is giving out they're, not numbers that I'm sure you want to, defend and they're not numbers that, actually fit the Israeli narrative in, any shape or form so no in fact I've, given Benjamin I literally wrote an, email that went out to tens of thousand, subscribers saying this is the Israeli, position on the numbers I've never, disputed Israel has different numbers, but Israel lies Jamie this is the, problem like I I trust the Israeli, military as much as I trust police, forces after they an unarmed black man, at a light say he was armed well may, you're anticipating my next question I, think I was asking previous to a recent, tweet which must have gone out with the, same art article that you mentioned on, Zeto uh the previous times you didn't, mention that Hamas was killed but you, did tweet at the end of March like you, just said uh to all those in the US, media and politics who spent the last, month questioning the Hamas Health, Ministry casually figures and, questioning the number of Civilian, deaths in Gaza here's Benjamin Netanyahu, admitting that Israel has killed between, 13 and 19,000 civilians again I don't, want to ask you about the accuracy of, either the Israeli number or the the the, homas figure uh or the composition of it, but we did have last week on the podcast, John Spencer who is uh at West Point uh, he's the chair of Modern urban Warfare, studies uh he has written books on, Modern Warfare studies uh and he said if, if those numbers are accurate uh that, would be one of the best uh combatant to, non-combatant ratios in modern Warfare, history it would be historical the, Battle of mosul was much higher uh and, and you mentioned that this all comes on, the most difficult Urban Warfare setting, that he's ever seen so I just interested, in how you would respond to that so not, a fan of John Spencer I think he's a, propagandist um but yeah why aren't you, a fan though let's just take because I, think he's a propagandist but let's just, take the numbers you you gave his, credentials you gave us credentials let, me respond Phil clay who served in mosul, who served in Iraq wrote award-winning, writer as you know just wrote a very, long piece for the Atlantic that, well-known anti-israeli Journal run by, an anti-israeli editor and he wrote a, very long piece in which he's pointed, out that the numbers with most actually, the opposite his numbers I haven't, memorized them but your readers can go, check out the piece actually show that, Israel's rate of killing is much higher, than Americas and America by the way I, was a huge critic of America's bombing, and musle so it's not like I was some, great defender of what America did Iraq, I wasn't a fan of what America did in, Iraq with Isis either they they were, over the top in mosul in terms of, Destruction but even America's, destruction in mosul under a and then, Trump doesn't come anywhere close to, what the Israelis have done in Gaza and, he has the statistics to show that if, you talk to someone like Andrew Gilmore, former un assistant Secretary General of, Human Rights he says the kill rate in, Gaza is higher than any conflict since, Rwanda in the mid 1990s Oxfam points out, that the daily death rate in Gaza is, higher than any conflict of the 21st, century and as for the ratio well I, don't believe the ratio it's nonsensical, as I pointed out in that Zeto piece if, you were to believe netanyahu's one to1, ratio you basically have to believe that, every sing single male man and boy who, was killed by Israel was a Hamas fighter, which of course I don't believe yeah, well I think the ratio is one to one and, a half not one to one um have to say, pretty much almost every man is a, terrorist and again that's a very racist, worldview which we've imported into, America now when we talk about military, age males at our Southern border no not, every Palestinian man is a terrorist J, I'm sorry to break you yeah I didn't say, that sir uh M that's the implication of, believing John Spencer's numbers so you, said no no it's not there there are, debates about whether, the now now I'm explaining to you that, there is a question of the composition, of the numbers of Hamas statistics I, just which I didn't want to get, into but why why intelligence believes, those numbers why is John Spencer who is, at West Point the head of their Urban, Warfare Institute uh a propagandist what, makes you question his his credentials, okay let's take him let's let's let's, apologize to John Spen who I don't know, personally I think he's blocked me on, Twitter I'd love to read more of his, stuff he I think people like him let's, make a more accurate Point engage in, propaganda on behalf of Israel there's a, guy in England uh who does the same a, former British Colonel the reality is, Jamie that the vast number of people, including in the US government right now, including Lloyd Austin the defense, secretary are all warning that what's, happening is disproportionate military, strategies from across the world from, the spa Spain Belgium Canada the United, Kingdom you mean all looking at Gaza and, saying what do you mean by, disproportionate what do you mean by, disproportionate what do you mean by, disproportionate just a random there, many statistics I already gave you one, kill a higher kill rate than since, Rwanda but let me give you another one, more buildings more residential, buildings destroyed in Gaza then in, Dresden in World War II according to, Wall Street journals own numbers again, very famously anti-israeli newspaper run, by n Israeli billionaire their piece, their reporting shows that a higher, number of residential buildings damage, in just a few, months you see the destruction coming, out of Gaza is proportionate in your I, mean when Ukraine I'm not this J when, you use the term disproportionality yes, it sounds like you're using the term, proportionality in the laws of war yes, which we had Jeremy rapkin my former, adviser at Cornell on who's an expert in, international law H and he pointed out, that proportionality is usually, proportional to the threat and the, question is what do you view as the, threat of Hamas what is the goal of, Hamas I mean the threat of Hamas is they, killed what 12 00 people on October the, 7th and in response and in the response, Israel killed 300 times as many people, so what is there what is their goal what, is hamas's goal what is the goal of, Hamas why don't you ask them I'm not, Hamas well you're talking about it I, mean that that matters ask Anis of I, mean look, Hamas Hamas obviously is a sees, themselves as an Islamic resistance, group fighting against occupation, fighting against Israel fighting against, Zionism we can have a debate about, whether there are moderate parts of, Hamas and extreme parts of Hamas if you, go back through history there are, multiple examples where Hamas said we, will do a hoodner we will do a treaty um, and there were many reasons why that, didn't happen when Jimmy Carter was, talking to Hamas back in the 2000s and, the 90s uh there was arguments at the, time from people like Henry segman very, famous American Jewish activist saying, we can do a deal with these people just, like you do deals with terrorist groups, the IRA I'm from the UK as you know, there was a long period of time when no, one thought you could do a deal with the, IRA or its political arm shin faine and, in the end we did and shin f is about to, run the whole damn thing of course thec, is the obvious example that's often, raised Hamas of course is much more, violent than both those groups much more, Messianic than both those groups clearly, uh but there is arguments that you can, do deals with them their goal right now, of course on October 7th was to kill, Israelis and take hostages and get, people freed from Palestinian prisons, and also some would argue trying to, disrupt the Saudi Israel rap roson maybe, I don't know enough about the Kamas, strategic internal thinking but that, might have been a factor as well I, suspect do you think their their, strategic aim to survive is to try to, get Israel to kill as many civilians as, possible yes to get the International, Community to stop them yes and Israel's, doing it because Israel's done well just, like we did 91 just to be clear Jamie I, think they're trying to get get Hamas, but let me ask you this no they're not, just just to be clear, jamie1 we did the same thing off 91 we, went into bin lad's tra Afghanistan and, who who's trying who's not trying to get, Hamas you're saying Israel is not trying, to get Hamas well it depends about, Israel country government ministers be, specific uh well the is is government, contains many people who are not going, after Hamas they are trying to go after, the gazan population they're trying to, depopulate Gaza they want to resettle, Gaza people who, have the people this is deflection Med, the people of, power def not Ben Min Ben not Ben gavier, what is the Israel Israel the government, who, who the war cab, the, waret, why from he doesn't control policy he's, not controlling the ignore the national, security minister of Israel why would I, do that he's not controlling policy he's, not controlling Israel he's not, controlling policy Jamie okay we got to, take a break who's handing out weapons, to settle is in the West Bank right now, to kill innocent Palestinians no Hamas, in the West Bank Hamas doesn't run the, West Bank Med I simply asked, you, what is Israel you need the state he, doesn't control policy that's not true, he does not control the war policy, towards Gaza that is true but he does, control the killing of Palestinians yes, or no I he shouldn't be he shouldn't be, in government he should never have been, there because of coalition government, he's there but that is not the question, M that is not the question reflection I, know I know you're very talent I know, you're very talented at this but that is, not the I said said what is Israel, Israel's strategy in Gaza and you said, they're not going after Hamas you said, who who in Israel the random guy in the, street who in Israel are you talking, about when I mention Israel I'm talking, about the the war cabinet who controls, the military are they going after Hamas, or not you said they weren't and then, you asked me who am I talking about okay, so you adding in Gaza you said are, Israel going after to Hamas I don't talk, about Palestine as if it's just Gaza, there are occupied Palestinian, territories record number of, Palestinians have been killed in the, West Bank since October 7 I know you, don't want to talk about that and Ben, does control policy he's handing out, weapons paid for by us to settlers who, are killing innocent Palestinians I'm, not just going to turn a blind eye to, that because you don't like benir I'm, glad we agree we both don't like benav, but he exists he has power over policy, just factually in terms of H going after, Hamas in Gaza are they bombing and, killing Hamas Fighters yes but is that, the strategy is that the sole aim no, because then you wouldn't be, depopulating Gaza you wouldn't be, talking about ethnic cleansing you, wouldn't be talking about moving to the, Sinai you wouldn't be talking about, what's the aim then M I think the aim is, to uh fundamentally depopulate Gaza yes, I think, I think it's to make it unlivable I, think it's to make Gaza unlivable is the, aim I'm confused though because earlier, you said you're not a war strategist you, don't know how you would go after Hamas, and now you're saying what Israel doing, isn't going after Hamas isn't clearly, going the right way to go after Hamas I, said I don't know what I would have done, to get Hamas in the right way what I did, also add Jamie we play the takeback is, everyone in the world pretty much agrees, this is not the right way not only is it, not the white way in terms of, international law and Military strategy, but let me ask you this do you think, Hamas is going to emerge weaker or hold, on let me finish a sentence do you think, Hamas is going to emerge weaker or, stronger from this conflict do you think, killing 30,000 people has been a boost, to Hamas or has it hindered Hamas I, think you've got more gazin who are, going to join Hamas or version of Hamas, in the years to come and by the way you, know who agrees with me Amy Ison former, head of shinb schlomo Brom former, Israeli National Security guy people are, not stupid even Israeli Hawks are saying, this strategy will backfire in the long, R and I I think uh we don't know what, will happen at the end I think it, somewhat depends on hamas's strategy to, get the world for is to stop going after, it I think we know that there are tens, of thousands of Orphans in Gaza who are, not going to grow up loving Israel Jamie, and if you think that you're deluded but, I do think it's incumbent on people who, say Israel is not doesn't have the right, strategy to go after Hamas for someone, to come up with a strategy that would, actually go after Hamas uh that that, would be different actually we have to, agree to disagree I'm a hypocritic in my, worldview I say first Do no harm if, somebody comes into my house and God, forbid attacks my children and my wife, and I say I'm going to go after them to, get revenge many people would say you, have a right to do that but I couldn't, go out and kill everyone in the street, while looking for them and you wouldn't, defend me doing that sorry except except, there's a difference on a state level, where the state's obligation is prot I, don't agree with that I believe in, Morality I apply morality to States and, to people you don't believe that there's, a difference between what an individual, can do to protect themselves and what a, state must do in order to in order to, defend its citizens in in the sense of, both being bound by certain laws no I, have been I'm Bound by laws as a citizen, United States States Israel is bound by, laws as a member of the International, Community and a member of the United, Nations you can you can wish away the UN, and international law as much as you, want but it exists and by the way be, careful Israel and supporters of Israel, you tear down the entire International, architecture you say that we're allowed, to kill whoever we like because we were, killed guess what it'll come back and, slap you in the face tomorrow the other, side will say well we're doing the same, thing how are you have any moral High, Ground against Hamas Hamas will say if, you can kill all of us because we killed, you then we can kill all of you because, you killed us it's a never ending cycle, of violence music I'll refer back to, John Spencer uh at West Point who says, uh he's not uh not violating the laws, and Norms that you're saying in in fact, is setting a new standard for going, after Justice the United Nations General, Assembly multiple human rights groups, multiple humanitarian Aid agencies the, British foreign Ministry multiple us, officials multiple members of Congress, all disagree with professor John Spencer, yes and and also uh the UN used to do, about 30 resolutions against Israel to, every one it would do against Syria or, North Korea and elsewhere the world like, is in a way it protects no other country, so it balances out Jamie it's fine um in, a in a column in the guardian uh you, said that Biden had the ability to stop, what is going on in Gaza um if he uh and, stop weapons going to uh Israel um I, guess my question is do you think Biden, is a war criminal uh for not stopping, weapons going towards Israel in what you, consider a genocide that is a good, question and uh by the way that Guardian, piece feels very Vindicated this week, because he had a chat with netan and, immediately net opened a Crossing which, again reminds us that American president, does have a lot of power and leverage, over these ra government if they choose, to use it look um it's a great question, I think that I interviewed Franchesca, albanesa the UN special rapporter for, the occupied Palestinian inter sum I'm, sure you're not a fan of and she made, the point that Biden could be liable for, war crimes she he could be in the dock, one day I'm not an international lawyer, just like I'm not a military strategist, is he a war criminal I don't know he's, certainly complicit in what looked like, war crimes in Gaza if as every human, rights group says Israel is committing, what look like clear war crimes in Gaza, bombing refugee camps killing people who, are unarmed killing children, disproportionately High rate then he's, providing the weaponry and to use an, analogy again from everyday life if I, give my friend a knowingly keep selling, guns to criminals and they keep carrying, it out you're implicated in that crime, so I think he's certainly got a case to, answer in terms of complicity and war, crimes and genocide and I think that, he's going to have to worry about that, both in terms of him and his maker both, in terms of him and international law, and of course The Ballot Box in November, where a lot of people who otherwise, liked Biden and defended him like I did, up until October 7th they saying how can, we vote for this guy who has so much, blood on his hands is there any American, president at least living American, president that you don't think is, potentially guilty of war crimes I think, sadly the history of postwar US foreign, policy is that every president has, either committed or or been complicit in, war crimes around the world uh even poor, old Jimmy Carter who I'm a big fan of um, you know supported the Sha of Iran at, some of the most brutal periods and we, can go through different foreign policy, periods I think I think Nome Chomsky was, asked this once and I think he he gly, said Gerald Ford might be one who, probably didn't get involved in anything, specifically during his presidency at, least maybe Jimmy Carter sadly look it's, not about individuals I know we can, personalize this to American Presidents, the reality is we have an American, government a military-industrial complex, which is complicit in horrible crimes, against humanity around the world and I, mean it's your interview but I'd love to, turn it around and say do you think, there's a president who hasn't done, horrible things around the world who, hasn't been complicit in the killing of, innocent people it's hard to think of it, Reagan Bush Obama drone strike I mean, very hard sadly and this is why you know, I'm doing what I'm doing at AO is to try, and cast a light on things we don't, really talk about in our political, system or our media which is our country, is complicit in horrible crimes around, the world the rest of the world knows it, but most Americans aren't aware of, what's being done in our name and, wouldn't support it if they did what, American wars in the last hundred years, do you think were, just a great question I feel like I'm in, a trump Sky hot seat right now um I, think uh I'm going to say World War II, was it carried out in a just way I mean, you know without getting into kind of, undergraduate level philosophy uh you, know you there is a distinction between, just cause and just means and how you, fight the war versus why you fought the, War I think World War II was a very just, cause defeating Hitler do I agree with, the new king of hoshima nagasi no I, think those were War crafts uh I think, they were you know and the fire bombing, of Dresden which the Israelis now keep, cting as see we can do it too well those, were war crimes don't was that was that, genocide in your, mind that's a good question I think a, case where we didn't have the the, genocide convention in the same way at, the time but if you look at some of the, things that some of the generals British, and American generals were saying at the, time they were quite genocidal, statements uh was it genocide yeah it's, a it's a good question I I definitely, think there's a case to have a debate, about it if you're if you're wiping out, entire populations um again intent is, important right Jamie this is what we've, been arguing about for the last few, months that's what the icj looked at I, would need to know what was the intent I, don't think FDR's intent was to wipe out, Japan I think his intent is a big debate, as you know about hoshan Nagasaki which, historian having one of the arguments, was nuke was was dropped not to destroy, Japan or defeat Japan but to show the, Soviet Union what we could do right, there's a big debate about strategies, and histor I wrote about it in grad in, grad school in your home country of, London at at LLC so I am well aware of, the debate part those I don't there's, part those debates neither of us are, experts on it but I'm just saying in, that case you could probably argue that, was multiple intents going on there's, not a clear it's not FDI World C up and, said I want to wipe out the Japanese, unfortunately many Israeli officials, wake up every day and say let's wipe out, Gaza which I know you think they all, have no power but they do so I guess uh, and I think this is the clarity that I, that that uh is good and is hoping to, achieve here um I gu I I guess I just, want you to respond to some of the, things that I'm taking away is that uh, Israel you wouldn't say had the right to, go after Hamas after October 7th but you, understand that most governments would, go after Hamas after October 7th um you, don't know how they should do it that, could minimize civilians because you're, not a military strategist but you also, you also didn't like how America went, after Osama Bin Laden which was uh, rather uh uh uh targeted uh because they, they crossed boundaries uh uh that that, weren't Theirs to go into Pakistan to do, it um and while the just cause of uh, Nazi to fight the Nazis was there uh the, way that America went about it could, arguably depending on what hor storian, say uh be war crimes and that might be, genocidal as well I I'm I'm uncertain, how to navigate as a leader without, being a war criminal when you're trying, to to to to fight back uh against uh, people who are trying to kill you okay, so there's a lot there we've got not, that much time left but let me just be, clarify because I don't want I know what, Fox News will take away from this, interview and put as their headline I'm, not saying the United States and the UK, were genocidal during World War II I, said I wouldn't have supported war, crimes like the dropping of nukes on, Nagasaki and Hiroshima and Dresden you, said could that be seen as genocide I, said genocide convention didn't exist, then we'd have to talk about intent I, don't see I don't know enough about it, but I don't know about genocidal intent, from FDR or Churchill so that's one, thing let's park World War II before we, get into a Whole World War II thing to, go back to your Hamas point I didn't say, I don't know how to do it without, minimizing that's not what I said at all, I know how they can minimize civilian, casualties stop killing civilians, deliberately I know how you can defeat, Hamas without killing civilians don't, kill the grandmother who has a white, flag Don't Kill the father who has a, white flag don't kill Israeli hostages, who have white flags don't kill the, world Central Kitchen staff who are, traveling in a World Central Kitchen car, that's not hard actually Jamie I think, I'm surely you agree with me that they, shouldn't be killing those people I just, but that didn't explain how to get Hamas, but you just said minimize civilian Cas, can we agree you can get Hamas without, killing the people I just mentioned I I, don't I'm not I I I don't know I, obviously Israel Hamas reques killing, the world kitchen stuff no no I'm saying, that I'm saying that within Wars uh that, that are difficult like this civilians, die and and horrible things happen I, mean I have a list here them, I'm not I'm sure Bashar alassad says the, same thing as you Jamie horrible things, happen we say no killed innoc, deliberately but I'm not in but I'm not, stupid and I know that Bashar, deliberately killed Innocents as as you, say Israel special treatment Assad Putin, are baddies that's a very cartoonish, view of the world actually lots of, governments kill innocent people, deliberately including our own and, Israel has clearly done that over the, last few months and where they haven't, done it deliberately they've done it, recklessly I don't know if you've seen, the N9 where has where the 972 reporting, is is using AI to send bombs into, militants homes and they wait for the, militants I don't want to let that pass, what uh can you name the civilians our, government has deliberately killed or or, don't have to name the names but who who, has our who has the American government, civilans deliberately killed go to Iraq, and check out the number of massacres we, carried out mahmuda balad uh should we, go through all the list of number of, Iraq who were killed by American troops, deliberately so Americans deliberately, as a government policy deliberately, killed civilians no as a government, policy as a government policy launched, an illegal War based on a lie if we're, going to talk about Iraq in which George, Bush dick chaining Q yes knowingly drop, bombs on civilian areas knowing, civilians will get killed for a lie, that's very different than what we're, talking about you said they knowingly, you said a lot of people knowingly kill, civilians meaning intentionally kill, civilians to go back to your Biden, question if you're going to talk about, presidents who are guilty of war crimes, Bush and chenes there's no debate they, should be in the ha okay I I I have a, few more questions left I I just need to, clarify the Hamas because I don't want, people you takeway I don't want your, summary to be in accurate just to finish, very briefly on the Hamas point I am, saying I actually question the entire, premise of the interview which is that, the only way to get Hamas is to go into, Gaza and kill lots of people I actually, think the best way to defeat Hamas is to, bring peace to the region treat, Palestinians with equality and dignity I, agree with schlom Mo Bram who says you, cannot indin indefinitely control a, foreign people forever and expect no, response schlom Mo Bram Israeli General, says the oppressed will eventually Rise, Against The oppressor his word's not, mine I believe the way you defeat Hamas, and all terrorist groups including, Al-Qaeda is to deal with the underlying, conditions deal with the Grievances deal, with the anger deal with the inequality, deal with the injustices and then you, don't get violent Messianic groups, exploiting them to get recruited I think, Israel's war in Gaza has helped Hamas by, creating an entire generations of, Palestinians who legitimately hate, Israel for what's been done I have I, have just a few more questions but I, just want to get see Clarity there are, you saying that Dick Cheney, intentionally not to get a military T, civilians didn't die in in an attempt to, get a military Target they intentionally, were fight ordered missiles to be fired, against civilians in Iraq for no, military purpose you know that Henry, Kissinger did the same thing right in, Cambodia Vietnam he was given you agree, it's fine okay I I just I just wanted to, to to make Clarity there that's fine, maybe I'm naive but I just want if you, want real CL are you I don't know what, your question is are you asking me did, Dick Cheney like assassinate named, Iraqis that I don't know did Dick Cheney, and George Bush sign off on a war in, which we bombed civilian neighborhoods, based on a lie knowing that civilians, would be killed yes they did that's a, war, cry but they I mean I'm not trying to, parse things you you said I'm I'm going, to move past this you mentioned that, that Israel uh targets civilians not out, of parting to try to get a Hamas figure, but directly and deliberately and you, mentioned the world, kitchen look look at the words you use, jie 972 magazine makes it clear that, they wait for the militant this AI, system that Israel is using with no, checks and balances to wait for the, militant to get home to the wife kid and, then bomb him even if he doesn't get, home now you could say we're trying to, kill The Fighter by the way that's not, legal Jamie in fact you mentioned Iraq, earlier Americans had to check American, Military in the field had to check with, their superiors before they took out a, terrorist if he was around civilians, Israel's not doing that they're, delegating it to AI yeah um there was a, new report out I haven't seen Israel I, think Israel denied that report but, let's let's get beyond that think, killing civilians uh I don't I don't, believe they are deliberately going, after civilians I they're going after, how do you children's bodies being, brought into hospitals with gun shot, sniper shots to the Head how do you, explain that if there are individuals on, the ground that first of all I I don't I, I'm not on the ground I don't know that, but if if the reporting, the is it possible that individuals uh, operating outside of what the IDF has, instructed did something yes and they, should be tried but but we have two, minutes left uh Med so I want to go to, kind of the final questions here um do, you still plan to vote for Joe Biden in, 2024, $64,000 Question Jamie wherever I go, especially in Muslim and Lefty circles, it's the first question that's raised, who do we vote for do we vote for the, fascist or would he vote for the guy, who's complicit in genocide it's really, hard if You' asked me this on October, 6th it would have been a very easy, answer I said yes of course actually, he's done a pretty good job I still, think he's done a very good job on the, on you know in the domestic terms he's, done much better than we thought look at, the jobs report out the day we're taping, but the Gaza issue is a huge issue, morally I understand the threat from, Trump I'm under no Illusions I do not, want a trump presidency I think we can, agree on that that Trump is a threat to, democracy I think that's one area we can, agree on um but it's very hard morally, to make the case for voting for Joe B I, I I I tell other people vote for lesser, to evil but even this year I'm, struggling I'm struggling Jamie luckily, you know depends where you live in, America not everyone has that struggle, we have a system where only a couple of, States really matter but there are big, Muslim and young and black and Lefty, populations in Georgia in Michigan and, I've been to both places and they are, struggling with what they're going to do, and I wish Joe Biden would come out, properly for a ceasefire I wish he would, restrain uh Jo Benjamin N I wish he, would call for peace in the Middle East, and some kind of statehood for the, Palestinians that might ameliorate it, but it might be too late too I mean, Jamie had do you go up to someone in, Dearborn Michigan or Atlanta Georgia, who's lost 20 members of their family, and say you should vote for Joe Biden, could you do that I couldn't do that so, are you not voting for I I guess you, haven't you're undecided I haven't deed, and my final question is um I've always, been for a two-state solution um but, I've never been under the illusion of, what a second a Palestinian state would, look like what do you think a, Palestinian state would look like would, it be a free and open Society a, democracy I don't know I don't think the, Israelis would ever allow a Palestinian, state to be free and independent even, the United States really only support, some kind of you know state lit I, support uh I used to support two-state, solution I no longer do I support equal, rights for everyone in the region uh, whether that means one state bational, state Federation but I believe everyone, should live side by side equality that's, what you know when Americans are told, that the two State solution is no longer, on the table which let's be honest it, isn't they also support if you look at, the polling from the University of, Maryland rights we're Americans I, believe in people from different, ethnicities and backgrounds and tribes, should be able to live under one, Constitution uh as a democracy in a, bational secular State that's what I, would I'm not Palestinian I'm not, Israeli let them decide I'm not going to, impose My Views but do I support, equality for everyone in that part of, the world yes the Jews are not leaving, the Arabs are not leaving Palestinians, are there Israelis are there that's the, reality on the ground let's have a, democracy one person one vote what do, you make though of the fact that uh and, maybe you're dispute it's a fact that uh, Israeli Arabs within Israel have more, rights than basically any Arab in the, Middle, East I do dispute that a little bit but, do um but what am I supposed to make of, I don't know what you want me to do that, what within the Jewish State okay here's, let me let me take your question and run, with it and unfortunately I do have to, run off this but let me tell let me tell, you this I'm glad you raised that, because I saw an interview with UT, recently where he was asked about one, state why not one state and he said no, no we need separation Palestinian, Israelis need separation if that's the, case what do you do with the oneth of, the Israeli population that is pales do, you tell them to leave as well and if, you can live with oneth of the, population that's Palestinian then why, can't you have one state for everyone ah, unless you want to maintain the Jewish, majority at all times that's a different, question but I think everyone should be, able to live side by side as equals if, Israel is equality if Israel is a, country with equality which I don't, think it is but let's say it is then why, not have that for everyone one person, one vote Jamie I'm an American I believe, very much in one person I doubt that, ahart was talking about eliminating the, one, of my point is that's the logic of your, argument when you say separation, of the Palestinians in your country then, moner Abus is kind of the the leader of, the Palestinians or at least one faction, of the Palestinians in the Arab world, believes that Israel is will always be a, Jewish State and he's happy uh to to be, part of the Democracy there so I I don't, I don't see those as uh contradictory, many Palestinians don't as you know I, can cite to you multiple Palestinian, lawmakers who've been injected from the, knesset you know why Jamie because they, tried to sponsor a bill saying let's, make this an equal country for everyone, and they were chucked out of the canessa, what kind of country says we can't have, a bill that says every 's equal weird, right we democracy well well okay let me, just end on this then I actually asked, about a decade ago the then Palestinian, ambassador to the United States can a, Jew live in the West Bank uh in a can, you imagine a Jewish mayor uh in in the, West Bank in a Palestinian State and he, said uh to the point of what you said no, there needs to be a separation this, needs to have two separate societies so, you're you're wanting to create a state, I guess and I understand I would too I, guess, I believe in equality how it looks I, don't know but interesting you mentioned, Jew in the West Bank recently the, Israeli military killed a Jewish, Palestinian in the West Bank because, they didn't believe he was Jewish, because he's Palestinian how ironic yeah, medy uh I appreciated the discussion I, too believe in equality um uh and thank, you for joining the dispatch podcast, thanks for having me Jamie appreciate it","shortTranscript":"now you could say we're trying to kill, The Fighter by the way that's not legal, Jamie in fact you mentioned Iraq earlier, Americans had to check American Military, in the field had to check with their, superiors before they took

watch this clip, every one of you is sat through one of, those diversity training sessions and, thought this is some,  and it's not just you over 900, Studies have shown that Dei programs, don't make the workplace better for, minorities in fact it can actually make, things worse because of the backlash, effect Charlamagne the god went on to, liken Dei to DARE programs remember, those and saying they don't work Dei, training is like Dare for racism and and, you all know how effective that was I, was sitting there going oh there's, a ton of fun drugs I should, try I didn't even know about Molly, thanks officer, John but the biggest failure of Dei is, that the number of black people in power, at big companies is basically the same, as it was five years ago so I saw this, clip going viral on X um I think he, makes a lot of good points speaking to, how these Studies have shown that it, actually doesn't work that it's not, leading to increased representation of, uh minority people in the business world, and also voicing something that I've, voiced before which is that when I've, the one time in my life where I went, through one of these kinds of things at, a large corporation the minority people, who had to sit through through it seem, to hate it just as much as everyone else, I think what's important to note here I, made this exact argument that Charlene, the God is making yesterday that the, goal should be to actually make the, experiences of you know diverse people, in the workplace not an experience of, prejudice that it's not a kind of um, extra bonus to uh nonwhite men and, straight white men in the workplace it's, an acknowledgement that there are, inequities that in terms of their actual, treatment and opportunity because of, their identity and that it's go the goal, is to get rid of the prejudices that, exist against people Mike and and that, these programs are not actually doing, that and they're largely HR programs, that are intended to guard the company, against any kind of lawsuit from, employees who articulate frustration and, actually Sue over the fact that they, have been discriminated against in the, workplace the company can then say I've, got these policies in place I did, everything that I could do that being, said I don't think that we have this, conversation and make these kinds of I, think substantive and good criticisms, without pointing out what people like, Christopher rufo have said their goal is, with respect to the term Dei much like, he said explicitly with respect to, critical race Theory his goal is to take, these terms and make them sort of, amorphous so that people can project, whatever concern they have on this, specific word and so they no longer, might say not everybody but some people, who might no longer feel able to say, something that is frankly more, explicitly racist can now say they have, a concern about Dei and it kind of, whitewashes the complaint we saw this a, little bit with the Elon Musk, complaining about the existence of black, Pilots there's no literature there's no, statistic there's no study that shows, that black Pilots are any less safe than, Pilots of any other race that they're, involved in any more incidences of, crashes or other kind of error than any, other kind of race yet he posts a, picture of a black pilot and says is, this Dei would you be feel safe to um, fly on this plane or reacts to to a post, like that, positively and you can kind of accept, that in the mainstream in the way you, wouldn't be able to make an open, statement about how I just don't like, black Pilots you know I think Dei unlike, critical race Theory actually refers to, something that is a bit more tangible I, mean critical race theory is an academic, well it's an academic discipline it's, not there wasn't a there wasn't a CR, actually a critical race Theory program, it was a component of the let me it was, a component of the curriculum for law, schools and graduate schools and it made, its way the term appears in some of the, training materials in diversity, workshops Dei unlike that term is a is a, is an agenda and a program and there are, people who work in that field who do, that kind of teaching and instructing in, corporations and in schools and in other, places so I don't I I do think some, conservatives have brought in the term, Beyond any recognition but at least when, you're when you're talking about that, you're pointing to a more tangible thing, that people have had to undergo a lot of, of people in their workplace and in, their school when someone says is this, pilot Dei or says that the um Francis, Scott keybridge in Baltimore fell down, because of Dei is that a reference to a, Diversity Program at an institution well, what they referencing there is, affirmative action is race based hiring, which well what what part of the the a, boat piloted as I understand it what was, it it was where was the boat from, Spanish right something like that at, what point is the boat piloted by, non-black people running into a bridge, by non black people I don't think it has, anything to do with anything well so how, was that de who was saying that who was, saying that it was de it was a viral, Twitter phenomenon that a video of, Baltimore's mayor talking about the, bridge falling and the fact of the, bridge falling itself was characterized, as a Dei problem yeah and people, including Christopher rufo and Christina, Pasha said you should not refer to the, mayor as a Dei mayor it's an elected, position that he's literally chosen by, the people you can have other criticisms, of the mayor if they're deserved but, it's not a a Dei thing wait well maybe, you were out that day we Jessica and I, discussed that on the show I said that, in terms of the pilots I mean yeah no, obviously it would be racist to say that, like black pilots fly uh the planes or, ships or whatever the vehicle is less, well than anyone else um I think the, criticism they're trying to make is that, we shouldn't select Pilots or basically, people for any other Prof profession or, be more likely to hire them based on, their race right that's what isn't that, right so the question is if these, programs are designed to try, to no to prevent people from not being, hired because of their race because, that's where we're coming from that's, what we all believe you should not be, hir program do you think but people are, discriminated against on the basis of, their race so what programs do you, Advocate they're discriminated in favor, of because no they're discriminated, against because of their race so what, and that's why Dei programs exist in the, first place so what kind of programs do, you think should be implemented to, prevent people from being discriminated, against because of their race or other, kinds of I think we should eliminate, affirmative action programs that give, people preferential treatment in terms, of hiring and college admissions based, on race that is discrimination against, people of the race not being preferred, in the application and should be, eliminated and is being eliminated by, court order in many schools and like 60, 70% of Americans agree including, Democrats that so there's many examples, of this here's one study that just came, up from bodden college employers, discriminate against job applicants with, black sounding the study indicates it, was published last year in this study, assistant professor uh this professor, found that employers were less likely to, call Black job applicants with black, sounding names when presented with, identical resumes what kind of policy, should be implemented that's, realation right but that's not a policy, that's implemented to actually prevent, this from happening because obviously if, I apply for a job there's no way for me, to know that the reason I didn't get it, is because I have a black sounding name, yeah that should be illegal and it is so, right but what policy should be in place, to actually make sure that I not, abstractly being discriminated against, without there being any push back that's, that is why these programs are belie, rights groups that will sue on your, there's no way for me to know what, happened and the people are not always, doing it consciously so if your belief, is that black people and other other, people from groups that are, discriminated against just have to live, with the reality that they are not going, to be as marketable on the job force, that they are going to have less income, over their lives that they're going to, be discriminated in their housing, applications that all of these things, and there's nothing that you can do, about it and that we just have to suck, it up that's an honest position to have, but we cannot talk about the existence, of these programs without acknowledging, that they're there because we live in a, world where my parents were born into an, apartheid country had to go to, segregated schools and were not equal, citizens in the United States of America, and that those that reality doesn't, disappear policies and we should end, those policies and we should end, policies that award preferential status, and treatment to People based on race, that was the whole point of ending it um, so and again the the Dei policies, themselves do not fix what you're, talking about, right they fixing that that's a, legitimate criticism but if you're, making that criticism without having any, desire to get at the root of the problem, which is that people from these, marginalized groups are discriminated, against IM meaningful if you just don't, care about that and you have they like, well that's going to happen but what can, we do about it then I think your, criticism of Dei is in bad faith Dei is, is bad because it doesn't work not, because the reality that it's trying to, address isn't a reality I didn't say I, didn't say the reality I didn't say, racism doesn't exist I never said that, of course there are still racial harms, that exist out there in the world the, question is what we're going to do about, it and we do have a comprehensive system, of civil rights law that can bring, lawsuits on behalf of you if you are, treated racially unfairly in the, workplace as an a lawyer who actually, clerked in a court and reviewed those, cases it is almost impossible to prove, in those cases go nowhere it is, impossible to prove that someone that, the reason that your resume was rejected, was because your name was Brian with an, AG in it it's literally impossible to, prove how would I go about proving that, you you you get a a a civil rights law, firm to do this on your behalf I mean, there's a there's an entire industry, there's an entire category so I'm I'm, doing that with with my time and my, resources and energy you're just, cruising through the job market and if, you think that's an an appropriate way, for us to have designed our country and, that's what equality looks like hey, that's that's a stance equality looks, like people um getting disfavored status, when they apply for jobs or or uh, admissions to college who has a status, Asian people when they apply to Harvard, until recently the problem with that is, that white people are being maintain, problem is no the problem is that, Harvard's trying to maintain a quot of, white people and not have an all Asian, cast like so many of the UC schools, where they don't have those kind of, quota systems black people and we talked, about this yesterday with Amber black, Americans in particular represent like, 2% of the entire black American uh the, black uh population at a school like, Harvard the problem is you have a 40%, Legacy class that has to have their, places and that and other kinds of, trying to maintain a white racial, majority that's reflective of the, general population should absolutely, exing all of these Asian students, Asian-American students why is it so, hard to say people should not get, preference based on their legacy status, or their racial status right but is, Christopher rufo making that argument, he's not there's a there's a campaign, it's not he will get rid of supports, getting rid of no Christopher I what's, so what's so frustrating about people on, left keep saying you guys are defending, um uh Legacy status literally no is the, first thing about this argument is that, Christopher rufo literally says what, he's doing he's not hiding the ball he, says I want to take a term like CRT and, now Dei and make them stand in for, people's racial broad racial resentments, and you can either fall for that or you, can say oh I agree with the discreet, concern about Dei but what I'm going to, be very clear about and what frankly, Charla man was clear about In that clip, is is that the inequity the lack of not, just representation but what the, representation reflects about the, inequities that are built into the, system whether it's the number of people, who are represented in Fortune 500, companies which I think is less, important because I don't love those, companies in the first place or whether, or not it is your ability to be hired, because of what your name looks like or, get a house for your family Bas based on, what your name looks like whether your, housing value is necessarily, automatically lowered because you were a, black person in the house which is a, true phenomenon real estate appraisers, appraise your house as having less value, if you are black and there was a recent, New York Times story where a middle, class black family Upper middleclass, Black family had white friends of theirs, come and be in their house and took all, of their pictures down so that the appra, appraiser would give them a higher, housing value all of those things how, can it be how can it be F bad I I think, that is bad but how can you say it's bad, for the hiring official or the grant, maker to racially discriminate but it is, good and desirable to have a policy, of racial, discrimination I'm going to eliminate, those policies okay it's not a policy, that's causing people to be, discriminated against in reality in the, world it's their racism it's racism as, policy in Elite hiring and education, that is policy I strongly recommend, everybody read Nicole Hannah Jones's new, piece because she talks about how people, were making this exact argument like 10, years after the Civil War saying hey we, shouldn't have a freedman's bureau to, help process slaves integration into, society people who are for whom it was, illegal to read who had no schools who, for whom it was illegal to stay in any, kind of housing Etc who who had no land, who had no priors who had nothing in the, world that that program within 10 years, of the Civil War was eliminated, by racist I think it's fair to say, because they said it was uh unfair for, white people and put them at a strategic, disadvantage to Slaves we are going to, eliminate programs that are racially, discriminatory on their face as designed, by the law that is what the vast major, majority of Americans want to do even in, places such as California good luck to, everybody else out there more Rising, right after, [Music], this","shortTranscript":"and we do have a comprehensive system of, civil rights law that

it the platform, banned his show last week as Glenn noted, on X with no notice and no explanation, whatsoever Glenn added that the whole, thing is cough gas and that they give, you no explanation let alone any, opportunity to appeal or be heard here, to discuss this very Troublesome, censorship story about Tik Tok and, freedom of speech is host of system, update Glenn Greenwald friend of the, show we're so grateful to have you with, us, Glenn yeah great to be with you guys, thanks for covering this so give us give, us the facts um when did you realize the, show was no longer being posted there is, it is it Clips is it like short video, aspects of it from your from your Like, official account on T on Tik Tok what's, what's the, landscape right so our show is uh, primarily a show where there is live on, Rumble that's where the entire show is, broadcast and then hosted but we use, clips of the show like most shows do and, use various social media Twitter and, YouTube and Instagram and Tik Tok or we, have a social media manager who's great, and she takes clips that are, specifically catered to Tik Tok it's not, a crucial platform for us though we have, had parts of our show viralized several, times before and we're building somewhat, of an audience there and what's so, interesting is I've obviously covered, big Tech censorship as a reporter as a, journalist for a long time I've been, denouncing big Tech censorship but I've, never actually been victimized by it, I've never so much as even had a video, taken down even in the post in the pre, Elon Musk regime on Twitter I never once, had a post remove except I think one, time I cursed somebody because when my, husband was first entering politics I, couldn't handle him being criticized but, other than that I've never been a victim, of this sort of big Tech censorship and, our social media manager went to log in, to Tik Tok to post the L this clip and, there was a message she got saying your, account has been permanently banned we, hadn't gotten any warning we hadn't, gotten any notice and then she tried to, find out she did an appeal and we just, got back this automated note saying you, are permanently banned there's no, appeals it will remain banned and to, this very day we can't even find out a, reason why and you know it just goes to, show you that relying in any way on big, Tech I mean imagine if that were our, platform that we relied on it can they, can just destroy your platform they have, provide no explanation just the range of, permissible views is so limited narrow, on these platforms that this is why I, spend so much of my time building up, free speech platforms and alternative, platforms like Rumble now Glenn people, are going to hear this happen on Tik Tok, they're going to hear you say um with, how un outspoken I've been in the past, I've still never been censored on any, other platform they're going to look at, all of the members of Congress who have, been attacking Tik Tock pushing for a, Tik Tok ban precisely because of the, nature of the content on Tik Tok, specifically Pro Palestinian content and, people are going to look at the fact, that you've been doing so much important, coverage of uh what's been going on in, Gaza and the West Bank and they're going, to try to connect the dots and say well, do you think Glenn that you were, censored specifically because of your, uh coverage of uh abuses of Palestinians, by Israel in the IDF why do you think, you were, censored this is the most interesting, thing there has been a bipartisan effort, to ban Tik Tok the Biden White House has, threatened to ban Tik Tok from being in, the United States the FBI and the CIA, both want it banned and many Republican, presidential candidates and member of, Congress want it banned and the, narrative that they've United around has, been that Tik Tok should be banned, because it is a weapon of the Chinese, Communist party that is used to, propagandize the American public, especially Young Americans to be angry, at their own government now the first, time I ever started questioning that, narrative is we did once get a video, taken down it was a video where it was, where we were very critical of President, zinski and the US War policy in Ukraine, and it didn't make sense if the purpose, of Tik Tok is to be used as a weapon of, China to divide Americans against their, own government they should love my show, all we do is criticize the US government, the US Security State and as we looked, into it more what we discovered is that, this threat to ban Tik Tok from a very, lucrative market for them which is the, US has resulted in Tik Tok saying to the, US Security State look we don't really, care we're just capitalists we just want, to make money and if we need to turn, over to you the power to censor and you, tell us what speech you find threatening, we will do that we'll censor as you the, CIA and the FBI tell us to the way they, do with Facebook and Google and Twitter, as we saw in the Twitter files and I, think that's really what has been, happening is they have the the the power, to content moderate on Twitter has been, common deared by these US Security State, agencies that's very interesting yeah, obviously so so when the narrative was, forming that um that uh uh China the, Chinese government is maybe have is, influencing the kind of content that, appears on Tik Tok so I I think the pro, Palestinian views on Tik Tok are largely, genuine I can tell among young people, left leading young people I I don't, necessarily think it's being manipulated, I I can't rule out given what our own, government did to try to control the, narrative about election and Co on on, Facebook and x and other platforms I I, wouldn't rule out that the Chinese, government tried to exert some level of, similar Authority on whatever questions, matter to it on its own platform given, that we we now know that happened with, our own government I don't I think China, would necessarily be more well behaved, on this subject but you're saying you, think they want to get along with with, us domestic intelligence, agencies right so on that video that I, just reference where we criticized the, war in Ukraine it was taken down we got, a strike we were notified we could be at, risk of losing the account we actually, appealed that and they reinstated that, video the only only time any video, actually got taken down and they refused, to reinstate it was a video of ours that, went very viral that was about the, interference on the part of the CIA in, the Brazilian election in 2022 was based, on mainstream media reports and some, reporting I did it went super viral, because we put Portuguese subtitles on, it Brazilians were very interested in it, that was the only strike we got so this, is a video criticizing the US security, estate why would the Chinese government, be mad at us for that this the Tik Tok, also just recently banned any discussion, of that Bin Laden letter after it went, viral which blames the US government for, why 911 happen saying you've been, interfering in our world with bombs and, Wars they banned that letter and that's, the the the reality of Tik Tock Robbie, is that the CEO is not a Chinese, National he was born in Singapore he's a, capitalist he went to the London School, of Economics worked for Goldman Sachs, after going to Harvard business school, they're desperate not to lose access to, the US market Google and Facebook make, concessions all the time to India to, China where they say look we want to, stay in your very lucrative market so, we'll censor as you tell us and this is, what's happening with Tik Tok is the US, security state is saying if you want to, stay in the US you need to take down, content that we regarded as dangerous, that's who's in the driver's seat so I, can't tell answer brief for sure was it, our criticism of the Israel war was it, because we're criticized in Ukraine was, it because we're saying this about Tik, Tok I've done shows kind of Defending, Tik Tok saying it's not a weapon of the, CCP it's more that they've submitted to, the US Security State but whatever it is, something we were doing Tik Tok didn't, like and usually the target of our, criticism is the US government and the, US Security State that's what our show, is about no Glenn it's frankly sort of, overwhelming to keep track of all of the, censorship stories that are going on, right now uh you recently tweeted in, response to some Harvard Crimson, coverage of the house passing bipartisan, resolution calling for uh Harvard, president Claudine Gay's resignation you, said quote this is infinitely more, dangerous than any cancel culture, controversy that provoked so much anger, we obviously have been covering um, because it's so important uh all of the, Twitter files uh discourse and some of, the soft and hard pressures that were, exerted on social media companies but, now we're seeing so much very much out, loud sensorship happening in Real Life, coming directly from Congress putting, very open uh pressure in bipartisan way, on the kinds of speech that can happen, at our institutions of Higher Learning, why do you think this is um uh what did, you say infinitely more dangerous than, some of the cancel culture uh campaigns, that we've seen in the, past well remember the kind of cancel, culture controversies that happened in, the past so end up being kind of trivial, in comparison I mean like David Shore at, the beginning of the black Liv matter uh, protest he's a democratic operative and, he said you know what if you look at, history it seems like nonviolent protest, works better than violent protest and, that was perceived as a criticism of the, black lives matter movement at a time, when it wasn't allowed he got fired from, his job he became a folk hero he's now, very gainfully employed you know most of, these people end up becoming Free Speech, MERS they do very well over the last two, months you have had formal censorship, like Ronda santz Banning Pro Palestinian, groups on the University of Florida, campuses on the grounds that they're, giving material support to Hamas through, their speech you've had an endless, number of firings on college campuses in, media for people criticizing Israel and, now you have the Congress formally, telling private universities we want you, to get rid of this President because, they're not sufficiently hawkish on, stopping anti-semitic discourse in, universities you have this tital wave of, censorship that's very bipartisan that, come from the people who have spent a, lot of years branding themselves very, lucratively as being free free speech, Warriors and I think it kind of makes, all these other prior years of cancel, culture examples pale in comparison, though I do think there has been a lot, of censorship on college campuses and, that's the one argument I have sympathy, for which is these college, administrators don't have any, credibility to De claim their defending, free speech given how much censorship, they've imposed but now it's become very, bipartisan ever since October 7th yeah, that would be that was my criticism of, the responses by the college presidents, as well you know with the answers they, were giving are maybe displeasing for, people to hear but are brly correct that, the examples that we G well it does, depend on the context we all know from, First Amendment um uh uh litigation from, court cases on this that it actually, does matter your your time place and, matter of how you make a statement if, your statement is hateful but you know, but generalized or so specific or in the, face of one person these are actually, like the relevant criteria for whether, this is a legal speech or permissible, speech so it's fine for me from my, perspective when they were saying that, well it really does depend on the, context but as you noted you know the, criticism that uh organizations like the, foundation for individual rights and, expression has had for years is that on, on so many categories of speech it, context has not mattered in fact that, they sent set up entire bias reporting, systems at hundreds of universities, where you encouraged to report any, slight anything anyone says to you that, makes you uncomfortable that was you, were supposed to take that to the, administrator you're supposed to call, the cops about that and so now they're, saying well now now they're now they're, saying the correct thing and it and it, is terrible that they're getting, pressure to cave on that from a lot of, people who said that they were for pro-, free speech obviously that is certainly, hypocritical well just to emphasize that, point about context even though this, two-minute clip viralized of Alise, stefanic you know questioning them on, whether they regard advocacy of genocide, of Jews as incompatible with uh the code, of conduct on their campus the context, for that discussion what happened before, that Viral clip was what has been, happening which is an attempt to take, standard Pro Palestinian phrases, like inap which is just an Arabic word, for Uprising it doesn't necessarily mean, violence although even if it did mean, violence you're allowed to Advocate, violence against the state of Israel, just like you're allowed to say Boman or, flatten Gaza but what they were really, resisting was this idea that standard, prop Palestinian phrases like in Def or, Pal free Palestine or Palestine shall be, free from The River To The Sea are, inherently genocidal and that's why they, were saying it depends on the context, like you can't march up to a Jewish, student every day and get in their face, and say murder all Jews that harassment, of a specific student but if you want to, write an oped saying free Palestine of, course that's free speech and we should, be apping that and while you're right, that these universities have had a, history of censoring a lot of the, censorship for many years has been aimed, at Israel critics people like Norman, finlin being denied tenure or Steven CAA, being fired from the University of, Illinois for criticizing Israel it's not, like this is new and I think that's a, really important point is that, censorship of right-wing speech but also, censorship of Israel critics have been, persisting for a long time both in Camp, in the society more broadly speaking of, Norman finlin um we've been having this, conversation a bit on the show about how, to read the uh accusations of Claudine, gay Harvard's president having, plagiarized um in the con broader, context of what's been going on um with, the speech campaigns and the, conversation around what's going on in, Israel and Gaza uh you know even if we, agree that it's pretextual does it, matter if the underlying claims are true, through what should happen to her um is, it validating the Free Speech the attack, on speech to dismiss her for other, reasons even if they are legitimate and, substantive and does it affect the, analysis when you read in what has, happened to other Harvard professors who, have been accused of plagiarism like um, Norm fingon has accused uh Alan dtz for, example who has not obviously been fired, from Harvard's faculty have you thought, much about any of, this, I mean obviously it matters in a vacuum, like in theory if the president of, Harvard has engaged in serious, plagiarism it's considered whether I, agree with it or not like one of the, most serious transgressions that can be, committed in Academia students get, expelled for it at Harvard and, everywhere all the time there's no, reason she should be exempt the problem, is is that of course you can't separate, the plagiarism accusations from the, reasons they're being launched now which, is a punishment against her for, permitting too much criticism of Israel, on her campus you have Bill Amman this, multi-billionaire hedge fund manager, who's not only after her head on a pike, like he was and got the president of pen, fired but also the president of MIT, suddenly he's raising issues about NGO, spending and whether there's conflicts, of interest clearly the whole point here, is to punish these administrators for, purely ideological reasons of course, it's a pre-tax it doesn't make the, accusations inherently false I'm just, very, skeptical that these claims of concerns, over intellectual Integrity are, authentic and I think it makes it very, hard to assess the seriousness of the, accusations given how inextricably, linked with they are with the desire to, destroy these people for totally, independent reasons having to do with, ideology and, politics yeah that's a tough one look we, really appreciate you joining us today, Glenn it's always such a pleasure and, welcome to the club of people who have, been or shows have been banned on

fined him $99,000, and warned him of potential jail time, for violating a gag order the gag order, prohibits Trump from making public, statements about Witnesses and jurors, concerning their potential participation, in the criminal proceeding judge Juan, Merchant found Trump violated the gag, order nine times finding him $11,000 for, each violation, the judge said he wouldn't tolerate, further violations and would impose, quote an incarcerator punishment if, necessary merchin also said Trump, violated the order with social media, posts about Witnesses and comments he, made concerning the jurors and ordered, him to remove all of the post by 2:15, p.m. on Tuesday Trump's attorneys have, previously argued that Trump is trying, to carefully comply with the order was, only reposting articles from other, sources and that his comments were not, focused on witness testimony some, conservatives are growing frustrated, with judge merchin conservative AC, activist Jack PC took to X to write go, ahead arrest Trump throw him behind bars, Petty Tyrant Juan merchin do it let's, see what happens and what would happen, is that there would be rioting across, the country so I hope it does not come, to that um Trump has to pay this fine, for violating according to the judge the, gag order um in how he characterized the, unfairness of the juror who were, selected the unfairness of the judge and, so they said that that did violate the, gag order he says well he just shared, what Jesse Waters said about them or, what others said about them and he's not, giving specific information on them as, some of the rep's this is not what, happened but let's just for the sake of, example in a maximalist way and then we, work our way back to what actually what, actually happened if the rationale is, well if I didn't say it but I just, retweeted somebody else say it would I, not be responsible if I were Donald, Trump and I were on trial and someone, else said someone should murder jury, number three and I just quote tweeted, that wouldn't you say that I, was responsible for that that I'm that's, a tant amount to me saying someone, should murder jury number three I mean, no if I was covering this as a reporter, and I tweeted uh I someone had said, murder jury number three juror number, three I would be sharing the information, that some had said that I wouldn't be, guilty of making the threat would I, great great so I was worried that, starting in a maximalist position was, going to be unfair to you um because, it's not in fact what happened but given, that you even agreed that that's, appropriate I'm glad we started there, because Robbie that it absolutely is not, appropriate if you're a journalist and, you said hey look this is something that, someone said and you add context in your, quote tweet making it clear that I'm not, agreeing with this I quote tweet things, all the time that I don't agree with and, I offer commentary on it look at what, what this person says here's why it's, wrong this is unconscionable I disagree, with it that's not what Donald Trump, said if you just quote tweet something, without any commentary that is an, endorsement an obvious endorsement, retweets are not endorsed I mean this is, not what we're describing you're going, with are not end no people have to put, that in their profile because of the, clear understanding that retweets are, endorsing I go down favoriting things, all the time just so that I can find, that link later not because I, necessarily agree with it so that I can, bring it up on the context of our show, without comment statements that you, don't agree with I've certainly done, that before to share the news of the, statement I absolutely have I I don't, know I don't know what I I have nothing, else to say I quot tweeted columia, statements about the protesters to put, it out there if you think it's, approprate president of the United, States of America not whether, the you walked yourself into this now, there's nothing else to say if you think, it's appropriate and doesn't cons the, word appropriate I'm saying, is it violative of the rules against, threatening witnesses that have resulted, in this Gaggle I don't think it's, threatening witnesses to say that the, juror pool is unfair or the judg is, unfair that's an invention of the, prosecutors are out to get it that's why, I started with a maximalist version of a, quote we we're we're trying to isolate, I'm trying to isolate this idea of, whether oh I just quote tweeted it is a, good enough excuse before we move into, the substance of what the tweets, actually said but you already seem to be, of the position that no matter how, violent and targeted you should kill ver, number three the Tweet is that Trump, would be justified and quote the things, he tweeted were violent I think they, were his view on whether it is fair that, whether the jurors are going to be fair, to him and whether the judge is going to, be fair for him and he is running for, president and I would not hamstring his, ability to complain about the process, given that he is running for president, and that is what I'm saying so let's get, into some everyone else can comment on, the trial just not Donald Trump he can, comment on the trial he's not allowed to, talk about things that could be, construed as threatening to Witnesses or, to aine on the witnesses specifically, directly just did a whole show about how, people's subjective feelings about what, are things are threatening to them are, not necessarily the standard we should, all operate off of okay and I gave you, an opportunity to ratchet back to, something closer to what was actually, said and then we can have a debate about, how threatening it was but you already, committed to the idea that you think, Donald Trump would, be justified in and should not be, sanctioned for should not be gagged from, quote like retweeting a direct violent, threat someone killed juror number three, against a juror so I just I'm I'm, struggling I don't think I have to keep, talking I think I think the point is, kind of kind of been made although let's, keep going because I think that many, many listeners would not agree with that, position but they still think that when, you look at the fact of what Donald, Trump actually said and did he it still, doesn't rise the level that she you, raised a ridiculous hypothetical you, walked so that you fully I did not, expect for you I didn't ask you I didn't, I'm a free speech, absolutist I don't think he Bears, responsibility for that and I would not, put limits on his ability to run for, president and describe the process and, how it's being deployed against him and, let people agree with it or disagree, with it the question for whether Donald, Trump is the next president of the, United States should be left to the, American people not 12 jurors in New, York let's see what their opinion says, okay so first they address the issue of, reposts which uh several of these things, were um and so the court says the issue, of reposting appears to be a question of, first impression there's no this has, never come before the court before so, let's let's go to Common Sense it say, both the TRU Social account and the, official campaign website exclusively, represent the opinions and views of the, defendant and neither is an open form, for others to post about their own, content it's all Trump's words okay, that's how Twitter I'm going to your, Twitter feed to to retweet something, you've said that I absolutely don't, agree with okay defendant curated the, post that issue and then took necessary, steps to publish the post to his Tru, Social account so it's saying that this, was persful this isn't something that, could happen by accident this isn't, somebody else tweeting on his behalf and, moreover they quote Donald Trump as, describing the value of uh truth social, saying truth social is the primary way I, get the word out and For Better or For, Worse people want to hear what I have to, say that I have 7 million followers like, statements from Donald Trump talking, about what how he uses um true social, saying specifically everyone seems to, get whatever I have to say in quickly, basically telegraphing that this is how, he communicates to a very large audience, and Trump knows what he's doing is what, the court is establishing and then goes, on to address some of the posts it says, turning to next to defendant's post in, which he reports to quote Jesse Waters, exhibit 10 this is not a repost but, rather the defendant's own words Mr, Waters uttered a statement which, defendant altered placed in quotes, attributed to Mr Waters and posted the, purpose being to call into question the, legitimacy of the jury selection process, in this case this constitutes a clear, violation of the expanded order and, requires no further, analysis so so the court is saying first, of all it wasn't actually a repost he, put it in quotation marks but it wasn't, something that Jesse Waters had even, said and again it's a statement that, specifically goes to undermining the, Integrity of the jury process which, direct violation wat is mad that he was, uh misquoted there he can take it up, with Donald well that's not the issue, the issue is that Donald Trump can't, insulate himself for having, responsibility for this by saying it's, just a repost if it wasn't a fact a, repost you're just artificially adding, quotations marks around it if Donald, Trump loses the election after they've, jailed him for complaining about the, process half the country is going to, reject the results of the election and, there's going to be widespread social, unrest or mob violence and that is not, something I want to happen and so I wish, the people involved in bringing these, allegations against Trump that run the, gamut from kind of dubious as in this, case to very serious and maybe he should, be found guilty should consider what, they're doing for the good of the, country let's see what the court has to, say about the First Amendment concerns, it says at the same time this court is, keenly aware of and protective of, defendants First Amendment rights, particularly his cand given his, candidacy for the office of President of, United States it is critically important, that the defendant's legitimate Free, Speech rights not be curtailed that he'd, be able to fully campaign for the office, which he seeks and that he'd be able to, respond and defend himself against, political attacks for that reason this, court exercised discretion when it, crafted the expanded order and delayed, issuing it until the eve of the trial, the order is narrowly tailored to, prevent risk to the fair administration, of justice and it clearly and, unambiguously identifies the limited way, in which the defendant's speech is, restricted yes that's their, claim I mean look if you want to pull up, a specific post that you think has been, unfairly, gagged uh unfair unfairly p ized um then, I'm willing to I'm willing to get into, the meat of it and try to have a, conversation about it but I you know, this is not one of the situations where, an ad hoc rule is used to catch somebody, up this is he he was hit with this order, he was given a warning he was told do, not make statements about the juries or, the jury selection process that is, against the rules yes doing doing, so it's an easy it's an easy trap for, him to fall into it's not a trap it's, just the rules of court that every other, I got to say this every other defendant, before the court has to respect, everybody else and this feels like, another in in instance where Donald, Trump want special rules for himself and, different rules for the the rest of, American public this is how he had to, pay that huge judgment in New York in, the first instance he thought that he, could get away with saying that his, apartment was three times larger than it, was so that he could Advantage, himself himself financially on these uh, Financial disclosures can and the rest, of that a great example some of the the, law being wielded against him in a, unique in unprecedented way because they, never bring those charges you don't get, to lie on financial documents and say, well I should be able to get away with, it cuz I haven't be running for, president the United States of America, no it was it was in fact standard PR, multiple Financial experts have been on, TV saying to lie and about your the part, of your the side of your bank Fred did, they bring charges no in fact they said, they would happily Lo him the money, again certain point they did not it was, the government's it was a third party, subjective evaluation that they had been, defrauded that none of them agreed with, the square footage if your apartment is, not subjective Robbie it's math and this, is where Donald Trump is getting into, trouble there are there are more, subjective judicial system out to get, him there are more subjective, persecution arguments that you can make, let's say about the the choice to charge, him over the documents case when Hillary, Clinton and Joe Biden and others behaved, very similarly there are distinctions, there that we talked about at length but, I think there's better there's firmer, ground to Trum for Trump to stand on but, he is over and over again putting his, supporters in a position where they're, having to defend the silliest stuff in, the world including the idea that he, should be allowed to Target and harass, members of the jury and harass by saying, they're unfair they're liberals and, they're out to get me that's harassing, them I don't think that's harassing them, that's the root of our disagreement all, right it's the same thing that nobody is, allowed to impune juries like that, that's just not something that you're, allowed to do because there have been, too many jurors and too many mob cases, and too, many coercive death resulting instances, that have occurred in American history I, see inviting inviting danger to the, jurors are other members of the media,

education reporter at, the Washington examiner I'm here today, with educa House Education Workforce, committee chairwoman Virginia Fox Dr Fox, thank you so much for being here with me, oh thank you for inviting me Jeremiah I, have to start out um you had a viral, moment recently walk walking into the, elevator well Congressman Byron Donalds, was talking to the press and I gotta ask, are you ever going to start the elevator, caucus no I'm not going to start the, elevator caucus but it's very, frustrating sometimes around here jerem, I know the Press has a job to do but um, during all of our time when we were, trying to choose a speaker the Press, just almost harassed us and they blocked, the uh hallways they blocked the, elevators and I was very frustrated, because I'm always in a hurry and, they're blocking the elevator and I, couldn't get to it so I just said please, get out of the way so one thing uh, Congressman Donald said right after that, was that he he loved you know know he, loved you and that he loved he always, knew where you stand with Virginia Fox, what kind of a reputation you know that, kind of reputation of being kind of a, hard-nosed non-nonsense woman you know, you're the chairwoman of the committee, uh how do you feel that that that, reputation has made you a an effective, legislator effective leader and and do, you kind of embrace it I do you know I, came to Washington to work hard I grew, up extremely poor Jeremiah you will, never know anybody as poor as my husband, and I were growing up in the mountains, of North Carolina and so I haven't had, much time for, fality so I'm just a hardworking person, I've had to work hard all my life and, when I have a task to do I go about it, I'm very task oriented and I go about, doing it we have a lot of work to do in, this country our country is in big, trouble in my opinion I think we are we, are in big big trouble and so, my op my what I want to do is get to the, job get it done move on to whatever the, next task is and so that's why you find, me frustrated about not being able to, get to the elevator or people wasting, time because once a minute is wasted it, can never be brought, back you mentioned your you you grew you, know you lived poor for a long time and, I think you grew up poor extremely poor, and both my husband and I were fortunate, that we had people who steered us to get, a good education again you can get a, good education but if you still don't, work hard at it uh I don't think you can, be successful I've been moderately, successful in business as well as in My, Chosen profession which was education I, don't think politics is the Squan non of, a life so I think you can be very, successful without going into politics, or without getting a baloran degree but, you do need a certain level of skills, and you do see need a certain amount of, education and you combine that with hard, work and you can get a lot, accomplished you I think you were you, were firstborn in New York in the Bronx, right correct well in Manhattan actually, um down in on the Lower East Side which, was then considered Little Italy there, are SE several places in New York, considered Little Italy but my, grandparents my father's parents were, Italian immigrants met and married, teenagers or shoot my grandmother was, and so um I was born there but we moved, to North Carolina when I was six and a, half my mother was from that area her, father had been a coal miner in Virginia, he died when she was 8 years old from, black lung disease her mother moved to, the mountains in North Carolina to be, near family because she was destitute, and so that's where my mother grew up, and we moved there when I was 6 and a, half can you talk a little bit about how, you know Italian immigrant New York um, you know workingclass values and then, kind of that South, Rural uh you know you, know more kind of rugged uh values kind, of how did how did those meld in your, family and and in you as you you know, worked way through you know your well my, father was always a hard worker again, you're right first generation Italians, well well my grandparents worked hard my, grandmother worked at home and cooked, and cleaned but crocheted for a living, uh and so my grandfather started out, with a push cart and then got a small, grocery store they worked hard my, grandfather worked until a couple of, years before he died my grandmother, worked up until the day she died um so, my father learned to work hard he was in, the military during World War to uh my, mother had always worked hard so it, wasn't really too much of a it was no, Clash of values in that respect um and, my father adapted very well to living in, the South he's very personable so it, wasn't really much of a much of a values, Clash at all I guess maybe I was just, kind of how did like you know kind not, so much that they Clash but you know, there's it's certainly two different, ways in general of living sure but you, know and I was very grateful for that, again growing up in the mountains of, North Carolina I lived in rental houses, with no electricity and no running water, but I knew when I would visit my, grandparents in New York that there was, a different way of living now they were, again very lower middle class lived in, small apartments but I knew there was a, chance to have running water in, electricity um if you were put yourself, in the right circumstance so I was glad, for knowing those two, worlds is there a moment in your life, that you kind of pinpoint you know maybe, earlier in life that you know is you, would say is instrumental in how you how, you've approached life how you've, approached even governing in Congress, and kind of maybe like a character, defining moment um I'm not sure there, was my senior year in high school I had, a student teacher who said to me you're, smart you need to go to college you need, to marry a man with a college education, don't settle for less I hadn't planned, to go to college uh because I didn't, have any money but at the last minute I, took the SAT and I got into a junior, college where I was a day student and I, did that and then I dropped out of, school because I had no money again and, had to work went to New York City lived, with my grandparents who were still, alive slept they had a small apartment, with two families living in it and um I, worked on Wall Street for a while or, near Wall Street and then I decided to, go back to North Carolina and I feel, like God has guided me through my whole, life early on not knowing what I was, that God was in control I was a, religious person but I realized when I, was the president of the Community, College where I was, President um God said to me one day I, was working with people that I didn't, agree with and he said you know these, people are like Joseph's brothers they, mean you ill but I have a plan for you, and from then on I had a real sense of, God guiding my life and uh never planned, to be in public office when I was, growing up again just trying to survive, but I knew then that God was controlling, what I was doing so you mentioned that, you you know you were the president of a, community college what's more, challenging running a congressional, committee or running a a junior college, well they're both challenging you're in, the personnel management and so I had um, oh gosh about I guess uh not sure how, many full-time people at the beginning, about 70 full-time people but a lot of, part-time people and with the committee, we have approximately 50 uh full-time, people but our staff director does most, of the personnel management but as chair, of the committee I have to manage the, members and so that takes a lot of time, in a sense and I'm not managing anybody, else I'm not telling anybody what to do, but I need to understand what their, wishes are what their goals are and work, closely with them so that in aure in, personnel management and in you know, we're all independent contractors here, in Congress and people ask me all the, time why can't you all why can't the, Republicans do like the Democrats do and, get all together but we're much more, independent contractors on the, Republican side and very, opinionated uh you you got a waiver to, run the committee this Congress correct, which I think was the only one granted, ever granted right so what kind of, respect do you do you do you feel that, your colleagues have for you I know I'm, kind of asking you to toot your own horn, a little bit but do you do you pride, yourself on you know cultiv strong, relationships with your colleagues and, and and you know commanding that kind of, respect that they would grant you that, well I will tell you I am extremely, grateful that my colleagues did respect, me enough to grant me a waiver I think, my colleagues do see in me uh a task, oriented person a person who wants to, get a job done who's not climbing a, political ladder uh who has no Personal, Agenda I'm here to get a job done, education is in big trouble in this, country pensions are in big trouble, healthc care is in big trouble all of, those issues are in our committee many, people don't realize that and and all, labor issues are in our committee so, people don't realize that we touch, people in our committee more than any, other Committee in Congress because we, deal with people from the Cradle to the, Grave and so I I don't say that I'm an, expert in every single area but I think, my colleagues see me as working hard and, there's a certain respect that comes, with experience and again I think they, see me as totally devoted to getting my, job done and to, respecting uh morals and uh, tradition and the things that made this, country great Freedom that is so, important to us in this day and time, there is an Administration here that is, trying to take away all of our freedoms, and again I think part of it is I'm in, the right place at the right time but, again I see that as part of God's will, is to put me there but I'm very grateful, for having gotten the waiver because, what it allows me to do is put my energy, to work on what I know and by the way, I'm the only member here that really has, had the experience that I have and so I, think it it certainly makes a difference, in my being able to get the job done, what about this particular moment with, the Biden Administration what they've, been doing has made the education and, labor and Health Care oversight so, important well the the Biden, Administration is really radical in its, policies uh President Biden campaigned, on a free college education he found out, there was no appetite for that in, Congress and so he and his, administration they're trying to be the, legislative branch the judicial branch, and the executive branch so they're, pushing a free college education by, looking for loopholes in legislation to, um transfer loan requ loan obligations, from the people who took out the loans, to the average taxpayer who has not gone, to college and who did not take out the, loans so they're exploiting legislation, passed by Congress that was never, intended to do what it's doing to again, transfer loans to the wrong people so, that's one of the issues um they are, putting their thumb on the scale in, terms of labor unions the president, brags every day that he will be known as, the most Pro Union president ever and he, is certainly doing that the nlrb is, supposed to be a neutral Arbiter of, issues between management and labor, unions it is not being a neutral Arbiter, it is involving itself in doing all, kinds of illegal things in terms of, Union, elections and making decisions about a, lot of issues they're pushing, ESG uh in terms of Pensions which is not, supposed to be done pension the people, who run pensions have a fiduciary, responsibility to get the best return on, investment for the person who put his or, her money into the pension they are, trying to push their green agenda so, this committee is seeing every radical, idea of the Biden Administration being, pushed healthc care for example they're, trying to push everybody onto Obamacare, and deluding the good about employer, sponsored health care that's where we, get involved we we have the jurisdiction, over more Health Care in our committee, than any other Committee in Congress, because we have employer sponsored, Health Care under orisa and that's 150, million people they're trying to take, them out of employer sponsored health, care to try to discourage them from, working so we have every issue we do, have child care as you mentioned we have, every issue that the Biden, Administration is pushing radically, right, now on a legislative front you guys have, enacted you guys have passed a couple of, bills in this Congress um obviously some, of them they're they're unlikely to pass, the Senate under Democratic control but, you know one of the specific ones that, I'm thinking of is the the women's, sports act U the save I think it's save, women's sports act yeah protecting women, and girls in sports I think is the, correct title I have to think about that, a little bit but that's yeah but I want, to ask you how you know you've had a, pretty successful and you know U long, career do you see you know when you when, you're passing a bill like that um do, you feel like you personally are this is, kind of like a a you're you're paying, forward the the, the uh opportunities that you had and, and what do you see as your role as a, legislature as a woman legislator as in, protecting women's sports and women and, opportunities for girls and in high in, education right well I have to say that, the uh primary sponsor of that bill was, a man Greg stuie from Florida, but certainly all the women got behind, that bill and he's not on the committee, so it came to our committee because, that's where it belongs um but yes I do, feel it's important to pay forward and, to push legislation that is going to, mean a lot in the future um it's a good, piece of legislation look I I've been, castigated for um saying that there's no, such thing as a transgender one woman or, a transgender man um a person cannot, change one's gender and what we were, doing in the protecting women and girls, and sports Act was to say we want only, biological women to compete against, biological women and only biological men, to compete against biological men so we, were protecting women from losing, scholarship ship losing recognition and, just losing, selfworth from being able to achieve in, her sport by having men who have, physical advantages over women in almost, all cases from taking away pride and, scholarships and awards that's all it is, is let's recognize that women or women, men or men it's a really simple concept, God created us that way and we know that, so you obviously have a background and, higher education, especially campus Free Speech has been, an issue that you've done a lot of work, on um but over the last month there's, been kind of a a bigger issue that's, come out uh in ever since the the, attacks in Israel by Hamas uh and, there's been a lot of these protests on, college, campuses and it's kind of raising an, issue is is there a tension between U, supporting free expression and allowing, some of these protests and statements, from these students who are some of them, are, excusing the attacks uh what do you do, you see that there's a tension there and, what do you see is the the the, committee's role in in maybe over, overseeing this because so many of these, institutions are receiving Federal, funding well almost all in all but I, think seven institutions in this country, do receive some form of, taxpayer funding at the federal from the, federal level you know I'm very careful, not to talk about government funding, because it's money that comes from, taxpayers to the government and then we, spend that money on their behalf so yes, there's attenion and there are people, that would like to stifle Free Speech uh, the way the committee is coming at it is, we want the to be transparency in the, policies that the colleges and, universities, have especially public universities they, cannot in any way stifle Free Speech, we're very concerned about that and we, want to put all schools on notice that, it's up to them to inform students and, parents as to what their policies are, we'll be coming out with a bill probably, next week dealing with this issue but in, everything that we do we're, extraordinarily careful not to put, Congress in a position to try to one up, the, Constitution the Constitution is very, clear on what our rights are and that, the government shall not infringe upon, those rights that's the particular uh, way that we have to look at it that's, the the way the Constitution talks about, it shall not infringe and so we have to, be very careful about that in what kind, of prescriptions we put out but we will, focus on uh, transparency and we certainly will focus, on the rights that people have do you, does anything do do these protests at, all concern you about the state of kir, education that you have these student, groups um expressing support for a, terrorist oh they, absolutely distress me over the fact, that these, students close their minds colleges and, universities are supposed to open, people's minds and to help them learn, and it is really clear to me that these, students have had their minds closed by, being more indoctrinated than by being, educated and it is very troubling to me, that we have colleges and universities, with professors who are doing that that, is not what a college education should, be about and it's not what our country, should be about we need to make sure, these students are learning the facts, and not being, indoctrinated and last question you guys, just elected a new speaker uh are you, hopefully you can put this whole Saga, behind you guys of this you know the the, speakership and kind of get back to work, and and what do you have what do you, have looking forward what are you, looking forward to you in the rest of, this Congress well first of all I think, that Mike Johnson is going to be a, fabulous speaker he is a very kind, extremely intelligent very fair-minded, person who is grounded in the kind of, morality that I want to see a person, grounded in he is a real student of the, Constitution tion he was a, constitutional lawyer he worked in, conservative circles but his first, comment yesterday said to the Democrats, I want to work with you and I think that, was a very good comment to make he's not, going to um undermine his own values and, his own moral structure to do that but, he will reach out and try to do, everything that he can to advance, legislation in a way that we can make a, change in this country make good, government you said earlier that bills, that are passing the house aren't going, to get passed in the Senate well if we, don't pass them in the house there's no, chance they'll get passed in the Senate, so it's very very important that we, State our positions and send legislation, to the Senate and in most cases our, legislation is bipartisan but I think, you will see a a really really strong, and good, and, positive um speaker in speaker Mike, Johnson he is going to do a great job Dr, Fox thank you so much for joining us, today you can read more at, washingtonexaminer.com,

with um Israel, and like former president's Trump's um, former president Donald Trump's, statements about it as well so it's just, a moment in time like a human a human, moment in time and a political moment in, time that's you know that was seeing, unfold welcome to reporter's notebook, where we talk to the Washington examiner, top journalists about the stories, breaking on their beats I'm jantel I'm, joined today by White House reporter, Naomi limb and Naomi The White House, keeps talking about these split screens, and they're trying to show themselves, doing lots of government stuff, presidential stuff leadership stuff and, House of Republicans uh maybe not so, much less government probably um yeah, it's been this interesting contrast that, they've been trying to build and it's, sort of evolved over the past last, couple of weeks um you know first of all, we had the speakership Imp pass and so, that was a very clear differentiation, that they wanted to draw between you, know the White House President Biden, being adult and House Republicans can't, figuring out um not being able to figure, out who their leader is it sort of, evolved um against the backdrop of the, Israel war we sort of saw this, interesting um decision when it first, broke out where you know the Biden, Administration was still pushing the, president's uh economic policies and he, was sort of criticized for you know junk, fees junk fees and things like that like, or you know reducing energy costs and, which are important in like the broader, scheme of things but in that moment of, time people were sort of saying why are, you doing this their argument is that, they can chew gum and walk at the same, time you know that old that Old Chestnut, just don't leave it on the ground get in, people shoes we don't want that um but, and yeah guming up the system more we, don't want that indeed but it's been, kind of interesting that they I think, realize that with the likelihood of a, ground Invasion a very long ground, Invasion um by the Israeli Defense, Forces into Gaza that potentially now, it's time to sort of step back maybe, take an eye off uh domestic policy for, two seconds and sort of figure out this, big picture because obviously the Jewish, Community is hurting uh the Palestinian, Community is hurting and so trying to, figure out how to weave those things, together um but it's kind of been, interesting we uh I thought maybe that, they would back off the split screen, push just because of the nature of, what's going on overseas but we're, seeing now because the like the, continuation of of this lack of a, speaker that they' they've pushed out, sort of memos um you know basically, saying that that House Republicans, should join Biden at the adults table um, and that's sort of to contrast with a, prime time address um that Biden his, second one of his administration, dedicated to Israel as well as Ukraine, because the funding is going to be, needed for both of those things and they, can't do it without a functioning, Congress right and so you know funding, for Ukraine is something that has, divided Republicans but funding to Aid, Israel particularly in a time of need, like this has been considerably less, divisive among Republicans so I think, the thought process might have been that, that would be an impetus uh to resolve, this impass but it really hasn't been no, and but I think the other thing that, that the Biden Administration is very, mindful of is while Ukraine funding is, divisive potentially unlike the, Republican side Israel funding is maybe, a little bit lesser but on we're seeing, sort of fishes emerge the Democratic, party about how defensive um the, administration should be of Israel uh, was sort of seen very tentative language, from the White House sort of saying you, know um Hamas is not the same as the, Palestinian people there a dividing line, and really pushing this need for, humanitarian Aid um and trying to sort, of weave this fine line but we're, already seeing sort of a state, department official publicly resign over, this idea of blind support to Israel so, he has to be sort of it might not be as, hard and fast as Ukraine funding, argument but there nuances that he has, to keep together with this sort of wide, Democratic base that he has before next, year's election but also just to deal, with the problems at hand sure so as you, say there is a risk for Biden that he, gets sort of beset on all sides because, there's a progressive wing of the party, particularly in the house that is out of, their support for the Palestinians does, not like the level of Aid that Biden, wants to commit to Israel and then you, have sort of the situation where you, have Republicans running against Biden, for president who want to portray him as, not really being that different from, these progressives exactly and so this, is like while he's trying I mean I think, he personally I mean there was like, reporting about how he changed like he's, been praised for his remarks by being, sort of very staunchly um pro-israel but, there was he's been to Israel exactly, exactly publicly like literally, embracing um Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu but I think there's, this idea that and he and I think there, was reporting that he wanted original um, you know original speech straight after, the terrorist attacks maybe sort of were, a little bit wishy-washy and he made it, more strident um so he does personally I, think lean a little bit more moderate, Centrist you know this is like the Biden, that we've seen through different, campaign trails and and through his, presidency he's that generation of, democrat where they they party was more, holistically supportive of Israel, exactly exactly but there is this Rising, you know flank within the party that is, a little bit more um critical of Israel, but in a way that you know they have, it's a just a very comp I mean to say, that it's a complicated issue is very um, understated or like it's like um doesn't, quite grapple the or explain the, situation very well um but yes he is, being attacked by uh Republicans but, they're also having their own sort of, internal party Clash on the campaign, Trail as well about how to deal with um, Israel and like former president's, Trump's um former president Donald, Trump's statements about it as well so, it's just a moment in time like a human, a human Moment In Time in a political, moment in time that's you know that, we're sort of seeing unfold right so, even in a time of

he has launched a, campaign Blitz uh series of Television, ads uh really to highlight his efforts, to lower energy costs this is really, important for Biden since uh as we've, reported previously approval rating as, president is just tied really really, closely to energy costs right you know, when they soared last year after, Russia's invasion of Ukraine his, approval rating saw its lowest ever, Point uh when they when they eased up a, little bit they uh his approval rating, went back up right now um we're kind of, in the middle of the road um I think a, recent thing from the Consumer Price, Index estimates that uh overall energy, costs under Biden have increased about, 37% welcome to reporter's notebook we, talk to the Washington examin as top, journalists about the stories breaking, on their beats I'm Jim antel I'm joined, today by energy and environment reporter, Brian deppish bran there's been some big, offshore wind news what's blowing around, there has been or I guess a little, offshore wind news if you're thinking in, terms of potential sales sure uh the, Biden Administration released its long, awaited 5-year plan for offshore oil and, gas leases it called for just three, sales to be held uh up until 2030, drawing ey from both uh Environmental, green groups uh you know in the other, side of the aisle as well industry, groups Republicans uh and Senator Joe, Mansion Who of course uh tethered, offshore wind production to oil and gas, uh in the inflation reduction act so, Biden is running for re-election he's, touting a lot of his energy and, environment initiatives and you, mentioned this Dynamic of how he's sort, of alienating people on both sides while, he's trying to win a second term so he's, trying to sort of thread the needle on, these issues what sort of things are, they trying to do to try to convince, voters that his approach is really the, way to go yeah so this is a this is a, really sensitive issue for Biden you, know this is not the first time he sort, of tried to walk a delicate line uh make, both parties happy and ended up really, just angering both can't have a skake it, and eat it too I guess uh you know so um, this is the latest example of this uh he, has launched a campaign Blitz uh series, of Television ads uh really to highlight, his uh effort to lower energy costs this, is really important for Biden since uh, as we've reported previously his, approval rating as president is just, tied really really closely to energy, costs right you know when they soared, last year after Russia's invasion of, Ukraine his approval rating SS low a, sever Point uh when they when they eased, up a little bit they uh his approval, rating went back up right now um we're, kind of in the middle of the road um I, think a recent thing from the Consumer, Price Index estimates that uh overall, energy costs under Biden have increased, about 37% you know these are largely, factors outside of his control but for, voters and for Republicans looking to, replace him in 2024 you know uh these, are obviously uh good lines of attack, high prices at the pumps Biden down in, the dumps yeah exactly I like it so you, mentioned the Russian invasion of, Ukraine and there have been all these, sanctions there have been all these, efforts in in Europe to reduce their, dependence on Russian oil uh but there, seems to be some areas where you know a, little bit of leeway there's some, loopholes in all of this talk a little, bit about what you've reported on this, absolutely so uh actually in Wake of, Russia's invasion of Ukraine you know, all the sanctions packages that the EU, passed uh were really aimed at either, Banning outright or eventually uh easing, off of uh Russian gas Imports and really, what we've seen uh the phenomenon that's, occurred is that India and China two, countries that did not participate in, the oil price cap or pass any of the, sanctions that the Western countries did, um have really been able to take, advantage of the lower discounted prices, of Russian crude they've actually, refined the oil and sold it back to the, EU at um you know at price so they're, paying full costs for refined products, for diesel for gas jet fuel those types, of things and uh India was never a huge, supplier of uh to the EU for these for, these products beforehand but their own, refining ACC activity has just surged, and their Imports to the EU have uh also, R Rose by about 70% year onye I believe, um and this has really called many to, criticize uh them of either like, outright evading sanctions or you know, and called or LED EU leaders to sort of, push for a new policy that would, restrict these Third Country sales um, because another thing that's happening, is Russia's getting you know the, dividends from these but they also have, a minority stake and one of the largest, Indian refining companies so they're, actually like directly profiting both, from the crude oil and the refined oil, sales uh so that's just one way that, Russia is continuing to to Pat its War, chest thank you Brienne always refined, never crude thank you you can read, Brienne and the rest of our policy teams, coverage and subscribe to the Daily on, energy newsletter at, washingtonexaminer.com, [Music]","shortTranscript":"this is a really sensitive issue for, Biden you know this is not the first, time he's sort of tried to walk a, delicate line uh make both parties happy, and ended up really just angering both, can't have a cake and eat it too I guess, uh you know so um this is the latest, example of this uh he has launched a, campaign Blitz uh series of Television, ads uh really to highlight his efforts, to lower energy costs this is really, important for Biden since uh as we've, reported previously approval rating as, president is just tied really really, closely to energy costs right you know, when they soared last year after, Russia's invasion of Ukraine his, approval rating saw its lowest ever, Point uh when they when they eased up a, little bit they uh his approval rating, went back up right now um we're kind of, in the middle of the road um I think a,

practically declared a, climate emergency uh which earned him a, lot of criticism right he says him and, his uh his proponents in Congress say, that through the inflation reduction act, they've actually done a lot of these a, lot of these actions you know by, streamlining renewable production and um, you know creating incentives both on the, consumer and the manufacturing side, welcome to reporter's notebook where we, talked to the Washington examiner's top, journalists about the stories breaking, on their beats I'm Jim antel I'm joined, today by energy and environment reporter, bran deppish brand President Biden is, under pressure to declare a climate, emergency what would that look like and, what would it give him powers to do, absolutely, pressure and recently so this summer to, declare a climate emergency most, recently in response to the wildfires in, Maui which are the most deadly wildfires, in modern U.S history for 100 deaths, recorded so far you know more likely to, come basically a climate emergency would, allow the president to do several things, the first would to be to invoke the, emergency executive power this is a 1976, law that would allow Biden to take, certain steps to circumvent Congress, such as on issues such as oil and gas, drilling leasing for things like that, certain things that Republicans uh you, know are vehemently against, basically things to stop fossil fuel, production and limit climate change and, Emissions obviously that the, Administration has railed against that, are and that it says are driving these, extreme weather events the second would, be to allow him to tap the defense, production act you'll recall this is, what Trump used, after covid-19 to sort of streamline and, prioritize production of certain health, health related products in this case, they could use the supply chain for, manufacturing of Renewable Energy, Products this would be solar panels wind, turbines just different Renewable Energy, Products that would allow the us to meet, its renewable goals earlier than, expected the Biden Administration for, its part has responded by saying uh you, know Biden said he practically declared, a climate emergency, which earned him a lot of criticism he, says him and his proponents in Congress, say that through the inflation reduction, act they've actually done a lot of these, a lot of these actions you know by, streamlining renewable production and, you know creating incentives both on the, consumer and the manufacturing side now, if you were to actually declare a, climate emergency there would be also, some pushback on Capitol Hill no, absolutely we would see a lot of, pushback Republicans and, probably know maybe some of the Mansion, Camp other states that sounds like a, summer camp, Mansion I would yeah sign me up, yeah I can't mention it others uh other, moderates especially in states that have, a lot of oil and gas production we would, likely see a lot of pushback there, um as well as states that were critical, minerals Mining and things like that, it's unclear if those would be would be, affected in a potential climate, emergency although so far this is it's, worth noting that this is just, speculation but did not declare a, climate disaster or climate emergency in, Maui as many thought he would he made a, trip to the to the islands earlier uh, this month and then and then returned, without doing so, and so there you know water is also, heating up there you've written about, some tensions between Japan and China, talk a little bit about what's going on, there what is the or the issues at play, I thought you meant water temperatures, and I was like we could go there too Jim, not a draft to drink water water is, certainly a to in the Pacific this this, week with Japan actually going forward, with the release of time several million, tons of water that would have treated, Wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear, power plant obviously that was destroyed, in the tsunami and earthquake the second, largest nuclear power plant disaster, following Chernobyl it's been efforts to, release the treated Wastewater into the, Pacific Ocean, really got a push from the government, within the last couple of years you know, it noted that these these big storage, tanks that had been holding the water, were about 98 full you know putting, leaving it with very few options and, they put forth this plan that basically, involves mixing a ton of water from the, Pacific with the treated Wastewater, and then releasing it into the ocean, this has done little to a swage, neighboring countries that made some, people very happy exactly exactly the IA, EA that's the un's nuclear Watchdog, signed off on the plan last month but, yeah China and North and South Korea its, neighbors have really been opposed to, this and actually China reacted, immediately after it began releasing the, water into the Pacific by banning all, aquatic Imports um all fish all marine, life from from Japan into the Chinese, into Chinese China's borders which is, actually a pretty significant economic, loss to Japan because China is a pretty, big Market they are a pretty big Market, they are a huge consumer of Japanese, seafood and other other Aquatic Imports, I guess other marine life Imports there, were also protests in South Korea and, Seoul and Beijing by consumers that said, they do not want to be affected by this, you know it's too early to say the, adverse Health consequences that could, come as a result of this Wastewater, being released so are people concerned, about number one Environmental, consequences and number two whether, there are health risks to people living, in these other countries exactly and, China's foreign Ministry and others it's, worth noting it's not just China, said that you know, you know too early to say whether or not, the contaminants that are still left in, the water or the radioactive levels you, know they've been they've been deemed, safe by the iaea but uh there's been, there hasn't really been enough evidence, on human health and on their impacts to, safely you know release it into into, things that could be consumed by, millions and millions of people around, the globe so thank you bran thank you, hope you have a fun trip to Mansion Camp, I can't mention I'm excited, we'll mention it next time, you can

that uh kind of stood out, to me was he said there was a kipc poll, that had him ahead by six points of, trump and and that's true but none of, the other polls have a margin anywhere, near like that there was a fox one that, had them uh tied and every other poll, that's recent has Trump by ahead by, between one and four points so Biden, pointed out this poll that that he's, ahead but then he also said well I don't, think polls really matter that much, right now it's too early people don't, answer their phones anymore it's hard to, anybody to respond to one whatever and, that to me was really interesting, because uh it's something you hear, people start saying when they're behind, in the PO welcome to reporter's notebook, where we talk to the Washington examiner, top journalists about the stories, breaking on their beats I'm Jim antel, and I'm joined today by White House, reporter haston Willis haston President, Biden had a big event talking about, foxcon it's a real call back to the, Trump years what was the message he was, trying to send MH I think the message, was all about contrast with this St this, is in rine Wisconsin uh near Milwaukee, between Milwaukee and Chicago I was on, this trip as a pool reporter and uh, Biden was on the site of this foxcon, deal that Trump really touted back in, 2017 and 18 it was supposed to be A10, billion deal I think 15,000 uh jobs, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker was, there uh Brian the former speaker of the, house was there this is supposed to be a, very very big deal the project uh, materialized a little bit uh but not, very much it was only like maybe 10% of, what really was was touted that day so, Biden was there um to talk about a, Microsoft project on the exact same, piece of land so again contrast my I'm, going to deliver where Trump failed the, president of Microsoft was there, supposed to be a $3.3 billion uh project, I think supposed to be like 2300 uh, permanent jobs something like that and, again just trying to play up that that, contrast between the two teams so, Wisconsin's obviously a pretty important, state in this next presidential election, Hillary Clinton got made fun of a lot, for whether she spent enough time there, in 2016 Trump won the state that year, Biden won it in 2020 Republicans are, having their convention there in, Milwaukee talk us through a little bit, about what the political Dynamic is now, yeah it's on to quit at all that this, was all happening in Wisconsin both, parties really want to win this state, very badly Trump won it in 2016 Biden, won it in 2020 he was there uh to talk, about that project because he's trying, to win the state of Wisconsin he also, had a uh campaign event in the same city, later on the day he had another, fundraiser in Chicago but I think most, of the money raises in Chicago is, probably going to end up going over to, back to Wisconsin or to Michigan another, state they really want to win that's in, that region so again that's what the, Microsoft project um was all about was, him trying to again show that contrast, saying he succeeded Trump didn't deliver, and I did and Wisconsin and recent, polling has been a pretty close State, Trump's had advantage in most of the, Battlegrounds but that's that's one that, they're really closely contested right, now definitely definitely it's really, interesting listen to some of the, comments that Biden was in but one one, thing that uh kind of stood out to me, was he said that there was a kipc poll, that had him ahead by six points of, trump and and that's true but none of, the other polls have a margin anywhere, near like that there was a fox one that, had them uh tied and every other poll, that's recent has trumped by ahead by, between one and four points so Biden, pointed out this poll that that he's, ahead but then he also said well I don't, think polls really matter that much, right now it's too early people don't, answer their phones anymore it's hard, even get anybody to respond to one, whatever and that to me was really, interesting because uh it's something, you hear people start saying when, they're behind in the polls I heard, Ronda Sanders for example say that a, whole lot last year there's historic, examples only only poll that matters is, election day is usually what people say, yeah I talked to a I talked to a, Republican strategist uh just a few, hours ago and he was saying that that's, a next thing you hear Biden say you know, if these polls continue to show in, behind oh the only poll that matters is, yeah is on Election Day but it's never, really a good thing for hear a, politician start saying things like that, as we get closer to election of course, we're still way way out there's lots of, examples of people being ahead or behind, and then you know things changing, Michael duus 1988 Hillary Clinton in, 2016 was believed to be way ahead she, was up by 12 points and a CNN poll two, weeks before that election obviously, ended up losing so there's plenty of, space to go but not a good sign from the, Biden Camp hearing the president saying, these kinds of things about oh we don't, worry about these these polls they show, that I'm losing right I mean conventions, have obviously been an important part of, you know turning points in in elections, so we're still pretty far out from that, but yeah obviously you'd rather be ahead, than behind absolutely I don't think he, would be downplaying the polls if he was, ahead in them so we'll see what happens, uh going forward there is some truth to, that that uh polls used to be conducted, on uh landlines and now there there's, just trouble people don't want to answer, their cell phone somebody really has a, landline or if they do they're probably, like very old you ex the sample older, very skewed yeah exactly and so uh you, know we'll see again the the polls, didn't really hold very well in 2016, they didn't they held a little bit, better in 2020 but they haven't been, super reliable in recent Cycles so there, is something to Biden saying he's not, he's not totally making this up or, anything but obviously there's a motive, there to downplay them because most of, them are showing him behind in many of, the key swing States so Biden made a, little bit of news with a rare interview, appearance where he talked about his, position on something with regard to, Israel he's been trying to really thread, the needle on Israel's war in Gaza what, has the reaction been well on the, Republican side it certainly hasn't been, good and on the Democratic side he wants, to condition future based on an Israeli, military offensive yes yes exactly and, of course that came out just a few days, after he made the speech at the, Holocaust Museum here in Washington, saying how he's uh Ironclad support of, Israel very much against anti-Semitism, there was no equivocation in that speech, he didn't say anything about, islamophobia it was all his support of, of Israel um so then a few days later, yeah we have this news about him, potentially holding back weapons the, Republicans are very upset about this, they even comparing it to like wasn't, this kind of what Trump got in trouble, for with Ukraine you know president, wasn't really supposed to uh hold back, something that Congress approved that's, not really his job etc etc they're, certainly upset about it um he hasn't he, didn't answer any questions about it uh, that I saw yesterday but one thing that, that did sit out to me was he was about, to get on Air Force One Yesterday a, reporter yelled out why did you hold, back the weapons he stopped he turned, around kind of had this confused look on, his face she shouted the question again, and then he would just walk right up, into the plane he either didn't totally, hear it or uh wasn't interested in, answering it for us uh mentioned it some, I think in the CNN interview but but, yeah this is going to be I think pretty, controversial for him we yesterday uh or, on the trip heard plenty of uh Palestine, protests outside of the campaign stops, this one he's going to keep keep hearing, about uh there's a lot of people on the, left that are upset about this so he's, got to kind of try to find that middle, room and he's certainly going to hear, about it from Republicans thank you, haston absolutely you can read

has set about 400, trucks a day uh which is close to what, was what was going in before the war and, it had been much lower previously in the, conflict uh Israel announced earlier, this week as well that they would uh, build a northern Crossing that would, allow a to get from Israel into Gaza in, the northern part of Gaza which is where, AID is most desperately needed uh and, Israel said that they would allow the, use of their ashad port which is just, North of Gaza as a way for a way to, allow a to get into Gaza via the, Mediterranean Sea and then transported, by land uh from that Port into Gaza so, all of this happened uh if you connect, the dots through President Biden uh, through the threat he made to condition, his Aid to Israel based on the as they, said concrete steps that they wanted to, see is Israel take welcome to reporter, notebook where we talk to the Washington, examiner top journalist about the, stories breaking on their beats I'm Jim, antel and I'm joined today by defense, reporter Mike breast Mike when last we, talked President Joe Biden and Israeli, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu they, had a very tense phone call at least the, way the White House portrayed it and, there were some demands or requests made, what's the status of some of those, action items so to set the context, around this call uh it's important to, remember that this call took place after, uh The Accidental Israeli air strike, that killed seven uh World Central, Kitchen Aid workers uh and so this air, in strike where Israel has since, acknowledged that they were wrong that, they targeted civilians and they fired, two of the commanders involved in the, decision- making uh that happened there, was International outrage uh and then, during this call between President Biden, and prime minister Netanyahu for the, first time we were told uh the white, house publicly said that they would uh, consider changing their policy position, their stance on it providing military, aid to Israel uh and so while they, didn't say they were reconsidering it, simply the threat of potentially, reconsidering uh their stance on Aid uh, was a major uh symbolic move uh that, actually got the Israelis to do what the, US has asked them to do for months uh, and so over the last week or so uh, Israel has surged uh Aid into Gaza, they've now allowed in uh the IDF has, set about 400 trucks a day uh which is, close to what was what was going in, before the war and it had been much, lower previously in the conflict uh, Israel announced earlier this week as, well that they would uh build a northern, Crossing that would allow Aid to get, from Israel into Gaza in the northern, part of Gaza which is where AID is most, desperately needed uh and Israel said, that they would allow the use of their, Ash Port which is just North of Gaza as, a way for a way to allow a to get into, Gaza via the Mediterranean Sea and then, transported by land uh from that Port, into Gaza so all of this happened uh if, you connect the dots through President, Biden uh through the threat he made to, condition his Aid to Israel based on the, as they said concrete steps that they, wanted to see is Israel take uh and so, far over the course of this week we've, heard uh us officials uh acknowledge, that they've seen these steps but say, they want to see a sustained effort, where do things stand with the ceasefire, negotiations that's a great question CIA, director Bill Burns was in uh Cairo, earlier this week for the latest talks, uh and so he presented a plan to the, Egyptian and qari uh Representatives who, then brought it to Hamas uh and so this, proposal included uh 6 weeks or so of, ceasefire uh where they would Israel and, international organizations would flood, Gaza with much needed humanitarian a uh, and in the first parts of this stoppage, Israel wants to see 40 of the about 100, remaining hostages released uh and this, is where things get tricky uh because we, heard uh reports that Hamas isn't sure, that they have 40 hostages that meet the, criteria for this first group of people, that Israel wants released uh this first, group of people people includes women uh, includes men over the age of 50 who are, considered not in fighting age uh and, then younger men who are in need of, medical attention uh and so these, reports that Hamas doesn't have 40, people that meet this criteria uh set, off some alarm Bells because it, represents uh the possibility that had, not yet been reported that more hostages, than were aware of could could be dead, at this point uh and so Israel still, wants to get their bodies back, regardless, of whether or not they're dead or alive, but it changes the uh some some of the, questions involved in these negotiations, uh and so while we're hearing that, progress is being made uh it's still uh, the final hurdle that they've unable, been able to get over in the past uh, that they still haven't yet cleared so, as these negotiations take place and, these reports are, emerging what kind of offensive, Maneuvers has Israel still have ongoing, so they're carrying out limited, operations mainly in South and somewhat, in central Gaza uh and so we've talked a, lot about Israel's intention to go into, the southern city of Rafa the US still, is opposed to such a plan because more, than a million Palestinians have fled, there over the course of the war so, there's now the largest concentration of, Palestinians in this city that Israel, wants to conduct operations in now why, does Israel want to conduct operations, because this is where the remaining, Hamas battalions that they've not yet, destroyed, are Sheltering and so from an Israeli, perspective this is the last remaining, major battle that they see that

less than he or she did 50, years ago after adjusting for inflation, that legislation would cut down the, 40-hour work week while still paying as, much as a standard 5-day work week but, he got into a bit of a heated exchange, when Fox Business reporter Hillary vaugh, tried to ask how businesses would afford, the reduced hours it seems like, Democrats want businesses to be taxed, more pay their workers really is that, what you think pay their pay their, workers excuse me I didn't get to ask, the question okay thank you Sanders told, vanon the legislation would reduce the, traditional 5-day work week over a, course of four years and employees would, then be given time and a half if they, worked Beyond 32 hours how are, businesses going to survive that that's, the question how can businesses survive, all of those proposals when Mr Bezos, pays an effective tax rate lower than, the average worker I think we have a, real problem in our tax system I think, that billionaires have

administration, President Biden is under a lot of, pressure to try and um end the Israeli, action in Gaza there have been a lot of, casualties and international pressure is, mounting so he wants to try and come up, with some sort of solution it's on, arrival because it's impossible to, imagine that Israel after the October, the 7th pogram in which 12200 people, were murdered by Hamas will be willing, to have a Hamas controlled State on its, borders uh there are there's a minority, in Israel who perhaps can still can, think of a two-state solution the BB, netanyahu's uh Administration has gone, so far as to say there could be a, territory which was uh governed largely, by the Palestinians but it can't be, completely an independent state because, Israel must now it has a moral, obligation to control security within uh, from from the River Jordan to the, Mediterranean Sea so it's a non-starter, uh now is not the time to tell Israel, they need to have uh Hamas controlled, territory on their on their doorstep the, Biden Administration is also keeping, hopes alive for an Iran nuclear deal as, the answer to instability in the region, yeah why is that an unworkable, proposition well it you know I don't, know how much hope there is but they, have not officially ended it but it's, it's an extraordinary thing not to have, ended officially because Iran is uh it, is right now for example in Yemen, advising hutis on how to hit uh American, shipping in the Red Sea uh Hamas is an, Iranian proxy so is Hezbollah Iran is, stirring up trouble against Israel, against American interest interests, against uh International peace, throughout the region uh um you know, it's it's a threat to our allies in that, region and notably Saudi Arabia um it, it's an extraordinary thing that the, Biden Administration has not abandoned, completely a deal which was you know, come to in 2015 and was very very, controversial at the time and and I, think really had not much chance of, working over the course of the past, eight years it has shown that it has not, worked and so and yet for some Reon the, administration is not willing to uh to, abandon uh that plan and it still seems, to regard um uh Iran as somebody that it, can ultimately negotiate with so if a, two-state solution is unworkable right, and the Iran nuclear deal is actually, actively making the problem worse why is, are these still the Biden, administration's positions well you know, Robert Gates who was Obama's uh defense, secretary uh once said that President, Biden has been wrong on every isue for, the last 40 years and uh uh you know uh, so that Biden uh sold himself to the, electorate as someone with enormous, policy experience but he seems unable to, think freshly and he simply comes up, with the ideas of his old boss Obama uh, and the ones that have been around for, decades um uh the two-state solution has, been on rinse and repeat for I don't, know how many decades I think that, there's a lack of imagination in the in, the Biden Administration and in the in, the state department um no new policies, are coming up it's it's very difficult, for um the president who's now you know, in his 80s to be thinking of something, new well Hugo thank you so much for, being here today you can get more, writing from Hugo and the rest of the, commentary team at,

Chris Kyle now, Chris was murdered in 2013 and his story, was told in the hit film American Sniper, today his family is joining us to share, his life and Legacy here on Washington, Times Higher, Ground now TAA with your story obviously, there's been a feature film there have, been books there have been interviews, but but really getting a chance to sit, down with all of you you know because, Colton and McKenna you were very young, when your father Chris was killed now, you're adult and I would just love to, hear from you first Colton I want to, start with you tell us a little bit, about what you're working on and what is, going on in your life well thank you, very much for having us it's definitely, a pleasure and we're excited to talk to, you too um right now I'm working on, American Sniper so as a brand my Mom's, done a few things in the past but she, specifically left it uh for either, McKenna or I or both of us to work with, and I have a passion for it and McKenna, has her own passions which she can talk, about but um I'm currently selling, merchandise so I'm starting with hats, and t-shirts and hoodies Flags decals, that sort of thing um my big Ambitions, are to move into the Tactical space and, Firearms so anything associated with, that if that's range bags or plate, carriers or that sort of thing um, there're definitely some big things in, the works um I'm very excited I just got, back from a convention so I'm really, looking forward to what the near and far, future holds for for myself and for, American, Sniper yeah it's amazing I mean this, brand American Sniper obviously people, know the name they know what it stands, for but what is it like for you to sort, of come into this knowing your father's, Legacy knowing who he was the person he, was and to spearhead that what has that, been like for you it's definitely a, blessing um I'm very excited about it I, know a lot of people would see this as a, lot of pressure and big shoes to fill um, but I've had the bless, perspective and opportunity to see this, is not I'm not trying to fill his shoes, and I'm not trying to take on anything, he's done in the way that he would have, done it but I'm going to do this in my, way um and honor and respect him and his, legacy in his way so what that means is, I get to honor him and pay respects and, move forward in what he was already, passionate about in my way and I'm um, really excited about that I feel good, about it yeah I'll say too Billy, yeah there was I think one of the cool, things of the many cool things I think, about Chris was that it was important to, him that Colton could be his own man and, McKenna could be her own woman and, especially with his son feeling like he, doesn't have to follow in his footsteps, you know there's some dads and we all, know them where it's like they have they, expect that their son does exactly what, they did or or does exactly what they, feel is best and they want to sort of, guide it but we even when the kids were, little we talked about how it's God's, calling on their life not ours, and um I know Colton with American, sniper in particular he's kind of pulled, it into like seven qualities that he, shares with his dad that he's really, passionate about and I often think I, mean we were talking to Marcus Latrell, to the Lone Survivor and he was saying, the same thing like he he doesn't expect, his kids to serve in the military you, know if they want to and that's where, they're called great and if they don't, they don't but it's um I think Chris, would be really proud that Colton's, making his own way and that McKenna is, not doing things you know the way, everybody else does either they're just, kind of forging their own path I think, he he'd really like that no I love that, I absolutely love that what an amazing, Legacy of trusting God to really let the, Lord lead you where you're supposed to, go instead of expecting something that, that maybe isn't what God has for you, you that kind of brings me to you, McKenna because you are doing some, really amazing work yourself you've been, doing ride alongs working with the local, sheriff's department and you have some, really unique goals and aspirations so, I'd love to hear a little bit about, those yes sir so I've been doing social, media for uh Sheriff wurn of tant County, and it's been really cool I really enjoy, it and um just kind of seeing what they, actually do I feel like it's so, different than what people think of what, it is and um getting to know the people, too is really Co to, me and I also um I'm planning on being a, Jailer for Taran County and I think um I, think that'll be really helpful I'm, planning on eventually being a sheriff's, deputy and from all of the deputies that, I've talked to so far they've all said, that that's where they started and they, think it was really helpful for them, they learned how to talk to people and, how to treat them just as as human, beings even though they've done things, that obviously we don't agree with but, they're still human beings and we can, treat them like that um and so now we, don't have to start that way you don't, have to start as a Jailer but it's uh, it's definitely, helpful and so Billy isn't that crazy, that like you can see her she's like, petite and beautiful and gentle and so, seeing her wanting to be a Jailer some, of my friends are like what McKenna but, you've talked to some women who are, Jailer or a woman who's a Jailer yeah um, I finally got the opportunity to do a, ride along with a woman and she was, she's a deputy now and she also started, in the jail and so I was asking her, about it because at first I was thinking, now that they don't have to start as, jailers I was thinking well maybe I, don't want to do that because it does, seem a little bit it does seem a little, scary but the more I talked to her she, was saying it's not as scary as you, might think and it really is helpful she, was the one who really kind of explained, it the most to me and I was asking her, like even as a woman like is it more, dangerous and she said not really it's, just that the um the prisoners will be a, little bit more disrespectful with their, words sometimes but um her her advice, was one of her go-to lines was what did, I say or do that made you think it was, okay to say that to me or to do that to, me that's actually a really good a, really good line AG like and so most of, the time she would she said that they, would apologize and sometimes they would, you know try to argue with her a little, bit but most of the time they would, apologize and so it wasn't necessarily, more dangerous it was just they maybe, had some more disrespectful things to, say m McKenna what was it and this is, just for a final question on this piece, of the conversation because I think it's, really interesting and important but, what made you want to do this job what, was it that attracted you to it um I've, always loved law enforcement like it's, always been something that I've been, interested in and when I was little I, thought oh it would be so cool to be in, like the FBI or something like that or, um maybe a little bit more recently I, thought maybe a detective, and so with the opportunity to work for, the sheriff and do his social media I've, been able to talk to detectives and, different people in different positions, and so I get to see what it's like, because like I said before it's not how, most people think it is and so it's, definitely always been an interest but, the more I learn about it I, think um what draws me to being a Jailer, is do like to talk to people and I I, like to talk to people that are in maybe, some worse off situations and I like to, be able to help them if I can and so, that would be that would be really cool, to me if I can help anyone and then on, top of that that is in law, enforcement and then I can work my way, to being a deputy I just I'm not exactly, sure what the main draw for me but I I, definitely feel very drawn to it I know, that yeah I mean you're called to it, right it's kind of like what we were, talking about before and you know today, I'm watching you listen to your kids and, just seeing the amazing adults that, they're becoming and everything that, your family has been through you have, faced a lot you've been through a lot, all of you together what is it like for, you ta to to see your kids be in the, place that they're in right now to hear, what they're saying pushing toward, success doing really amazing things and, doing incredible in light of all that's, happened yeah it's such a good question, too because I it it's I'm very, um I I guess there's like a a peaceful, calm about it because I feel like they, their relationship with God is so strong, and their love for Jesus is strong and, so I feel like that component is in, place which means that I trust that God, really is leading them right but the, next thing I I don't know about you, Billy but I was raised we're going to, college my sister there was no we're, thinking about college there was no we, might not do like college was it was, just going to happen right and I think, you know back in my day that was there, just yeah it was an expectation and so I, I I had the expectation I think that my, kids would graduate high school and go, right to college and this is part of me, doing this trustfall with God is if they, you know Colton's taking a gap year to, do American Sniper and I'm sure he can, tell you more about it but um how long, that Gap year last maybe it's a gap two, years or three but you know he they're, both really smart they've both you know, been very accomplished in school and um, he eventually like I'll let him talk, about it but apologetics theology I, could see him getting his Doctorate in, that he's talked about that McKenna is, brilliant and I'm like baby please you, got so many things you can do like can, we do college while you're do being a, Jailer like can you can we because I, think it's hard to do those things and, then go back having said that I know, plenty of people who have done exactly, what she's talking about which is they, went into law enforcement and then they, did college at night and they've you, know got their masters and so it is an, interesting thing as a parent to say I, really I I really am gonna let you you, know let you I'm gonna support you um, and going where you feel the spirit's, calling and I'm also a human being who, sometimes goes am I doing the should I, be pushing harder right but I don't I, don't want them to go do something I, don't think I don't think college is, good if you're going to be miserable if, you're already socially mature and I, think they are socially mature they, don't love to party they don't love to, you know fraternities and sororities are, not attractive to them and so I'm, thinking well then I guess you just do, it at your own pace I mean people do it, more online now I guess yeah that's the, way it goes I think in a few years, college is going to look totally, different than it does right now it, looks different than it did 20 years ago, when I went to school and it's kind of, crazy I'm just sort of seeing how it's, all going to shake out but looking at, your story Colton and and I want to come, to you on this because you guys were, really young when you lost your dad and, I I'd love to know how you dealt with, that what was it like to grow up having, this really public facet to this story, people knew who your father was and with, his death that was really out there how, did you navigate the public side of your, father and that loss well um definitely, it was it was very difficult um what, made it much easier was that even though, my dad's story was public and our family, story was public that mcken and I were, not and I'm very blessed to have my, mother's foresight in that and in being, very intentional about not having us be, public so I could we could grieve in, private and we could have our own uh, relationships and outside of the public, eye and what that really means mostly is, outside of the pressure of the public, eye not just being seen but nobody, knowing what's becoming of us and so not, expecting, certain things of us or reacting, negatively to anything that we might, have gone through felt whatever it may, be um so with that being said it was, still very difficult, obviously um losing someone you love is, never easy for anyone um certainly not, uh when it's unexpected and entirely, unexpected um so my coping mechanism was, to not feel as much as possible and the, best way to do that for me was to, distract myself so we had plenty going, on at the time my mom was doing a number, of things um including Patriot to her um, in the past few years I've really come, to I've uh gone to therapy our whole, family has gone to therapy for it with a, Christian therapist that comes out from, a faith-based perspective which I think, has been Monumental to my emotional and, um mental, healing my faith has been Paramount in, healing um the fact that I can trust, that God is at work and that he brings, good things through it and when you, choose to look from the perspective and, lens of this is a Godly worldview and, God is in this world then I can see the, good for what it is and when you're, looking for something you're typically, going to find it and that has been very, helpful to me just to be so grateful and, to really take in how blessed we are, that even though we lost someone um that, was so instrumental to our, lives that we're blessed even more, throughout and and through the loss of, him you know I'm not I don't like to, consider going back in time and changing, things or not changing things life is, what it is but I do see what it has, changed it's made me grow up a lot, quicker um mentally and um I've been, around plenty more adults and, a lot of adults in the service um in the, military and and Veterans and First, Responders and those kinds of things, these same people that have gone through, a lot of similar things with trauma and, maybe not losing their father but losing, many friends um and possibly children or, siblings whatever it may be and so to be, with those people throughout that was, extremely helpful as well to be able to, relate to somebody and have somebody, relate to me a lot of people wanted to, share their stories and um I was I, always had the opportunity to be, comforted by someone even if I had no, idea who they were because they simply, knew of my dad or respected my dad or we, were already friends and um they, experienced something similar so very, very very blessed yeah I mean what a, mature way to be looking at that because, there are people who are 60 70 years old, who have gone through hard things in, their lives and they don't look at it, that way they don't see the connections, they don't understand how God works and, it sounds like you really have a good, command of that now McKenna for you what, was that like because everybody's, journey is different there are UPS there, are downs and it can be a struggle what, was it like for you to process through, everything that, unfolded um it was I mean obviously it, was hard for, me I think I started off trying to just, find the positive in it, all and one of my biggest things was to, not focus on my own pain and to just, focus on my mom and my brother and how, can I help them and what can I do for, them and that kind of started a little, bit of people pleasing which it can be, helpful but it's also not always the, best when it's at the expense of, yourself so um that was something that, that was a coping, mechanism and then I kind of started to, do that more and more where I would, focus on other people's trauma and other, people's pain so I didn't have to look, at my own and another part of that was I, didn't really see the world as good, anymore and I didn't want to because I, felt like if I did see something as, perfect or good again and it was taken, away then that would that would be awful, again I would feel the same, emotions and I didn't want to so I just, kept myself feeling that the world is a, bad place and people are bad and so I, found friends who had gone through lots, of trauma and experienced lots of abuse, um abuse in different, ways and so they they shared my view of, the world and it was also helpful for me, to focus on their pain and try and help, them through their, things and so so now I'm this is very, recent but I'm starting to find things, that I'm grateful for and see the world, as better and surround myself with, people who do see the world as good and, who are able to help me and I also I am, able to focus on myself now and focus on, my own trauma and how I'm feeling and, kind of speak up for myself a little bit, more yeah that's amazing now now TAA, obviously you're a mom who's been, incredibly loving and supportive you've, been there for your kids throughout this, entire time and there's so much that you, can't control though even in being there, and doing everything you've done the, emotions the feelings that come from an, experience like what you've all been, through what is it like for you to hear, your kids talk through this right you've, obviously had the conversations, privately but to hear them share this so, openly in the way that they, have it's really incredible for me I, mean I just sit here and think what a, blessing that I get to hear them talk, about it and share like they're sharing, right now because you're right I mean we, have conversations along the way but, it's different when I get to sort of be, the fly on the wall listening to how, they would explain it to someone else, and so that's been um I've been really, uh delighted I guess to hear them say it, for a couple of reasons one is I hope it, blesses somebody who's listening because, I think the fact that we all had, different coping, mechanisms I hope makes it relatable our, our um experience and I also just feel, this tremendous gratitude that we've, come as far as we have because you know, there are times along the way you know, as a parent that you wonder am I am I, doing what I can do and I was in, tremendous grief and one of my things, was you know it was easier for me to, stay busy and we had way too many things, but they were also all these different, attacks and we were taking advantage of, and lawsuits and you know family members, that you know we all handle grief, differently and they kind of turned, Theirs to maybe, a more hateful place in my opinion and, so going through all that at the same, time I recognized that I was not the mom, that I wanted to be either during this, time and so it feels miraculous that God, is so good that he would do the work to, heal all of us because I could not have, done it I remember crying with Colton, one day we were in the car and I said I, know you know I just said I know this is, ridiculous and but I thought when I had, you that I I felt like I could be a, really good mom and I knew I couldn't be, perfect but I really felt like I was, gonna you know I was gonna nail this, thing then McKenna you know came along, real soon after and I was like maybe I'm, not as good as I think but I think I can, still do a good job and it was this, realization that I was so far from what, I thought I could have been you know at, especially had Chris lived but also just, in general like I'm just not at all the, mom that that I started out thinking I, could be because of the grief and the, attacks and the anger I had and this, desperate feeling of I'm drowning all, the time and I can barely stay afloat, and um and so I have I have prayed, prayers that I would not have prayed had, Chris not died and had I not gone, through all that like with McKenna I've, prayed you know crying like God I I feel, like I broke her heart and and the, window is done I can't go back and redo, it can you fix it Can You Mend it for me, will you do that and I would see this, transformation happen in her and that's, to me that's miraculous you know I mean, I would I would wake up the next morning, and feel it and and things like Colton, you know if you wanted to go on a hunt, with some people and he's very, responsible and you know me feeling like, and I mean I could just tell him and cry, and say I want you to go I know you're, very, responsible I also know that somebody, used a gun to kill dad so obviously I, know that there are dangers if people, aren't I didn't think there was anyone, with evil intent but if they weren't, careful and so I you know I would share, with him this is a big leap of faith for, me to say I'm not there to keep an eye, on everyone around you you know you're, 11 years old and I can't guarantee that, everybody else will and and like Colton, said he grew up fast and so did McKenna, and and I feel like it's by the grace of, God In, Prayer um and obviously I was doing as, much discernment as I could you know and, I felt like God was giving me to Peace, So the the human part of me could have, said no I don't care even though, discernment says this will be safe trip, for you like like I felt the Holy Spirit, give me that piece I could have let the, flesh take over and be like you guys are, never going to be around guns and you're, never going to you know um and so I'm, grateful that God gave me that balanced, perspective of somebody chose evil when, they chose to kill Chris you know this, guy according to psychiatrist and the, prosecution of Defense didn't have pts, he never saw it had traumatic event in, his life it was a choice and so I I have, to allow for that to exist in the world, and allow for the world to still be, far better than I guess I guess I should, say it differently to allow for there to, be evil that exists but for good to be, overwhelmingly um present as well yeah, it's that Ephesians 6 understanding that, this battle we have going on exists and, you guys experienced this right the, battle between good and evil you went, through that when something like this, happens a lot comes along with it right, now TAA how did you handle and this is, one of the biggest issues when you go, through something like what you did how, did you handle forgiveness how did you, navigate that it's been it's been an, interesting one and I definitely think, it'll be cool to hear what they have to, say too I um I remember one time in, church from family members that I told, you there was just there was some, destruction in the family and it was, heartbreaking to me and I remember, hearing a a sermon preach and say you, know are you pouring everything out on, the Altar for God and me thinking yes I, feel like I am I am doing everything and, I thought well wait a minute but if I, don't have them in my life right now am, I still pouring out everything for God, and so the pastor was very helpful and, said TAA it's the same as the Israelites, when God said go into this cave you know, and they decide you know two for it 10, against it and they wander and God says, you know you're going to be wandering, now for 40 years or till the next, generation and when they say God will, you forgive me he says I I forgave you, the moment you did it but it doesn't, mean that there aren't consequences and, so he was teaching me forgiveness is, forgiving what the person for being, human and for making decisions that were, harmful it doesn't mean that you have to, have that person in your life to do more, harm you know so that for me was a big, thing and and now I'm at a place where, where I wonder if there are people, that I felt just just devastated and, heartbroken over is there a place to go, and ask, for I feel like I've forgiven them in my, heart is there a place to go back and, say hey I I just um they're not asking, for my forgiveness but is there any way, to build a bridge I don't know I I'm so, I'm still working on that part if that, makes sense but um forgiving people for, being human and and falling far from, what was the intent that the intent that, God had for their lives is kind of where, I get to on most most things I can, forgive them for Being Human yeah I have, to tell you that's a really healthy, place to be especially going through, again everything that you have faced, with you know the killing of your, husband to be able to be in that place, now Colton for you how did you deal with, and navigate forgiveness, um I would say in a very similar way to, what my mom has, said having Grace and and trying to be, as understanding as you can that other, people, um like she said other people are human, and we make mistakes and um all of all, of us human beings are emotional and so, hopefully we can tame our emotions and, and use our emotions rather than our, emotions using us but it's a very, difficult thing to do that and we all, fail, so understanding that, um I've I feel as though I've always, been very introspective so recognizing, my own faults time and time again and, being able to forgive myself has really, helped me forgive other people um, recognizing when I was angry at someone, and even though I may not have gone out, of my way to hurt them I need to I need, to check myself and say do they really, deserve this or can I be better than, this and show them kindness, regardless um but exactly what my mom, has said you know we've come under Fire, time and time again it seems like and in, a way that only only would be, spiritual, um watching her navigate this and I want, to I want to retrace my steps a little, bit as I was talking about coping with, grief I talked about a lot of people and, I didn't really talk about my mom and uh, she's been very humble and vulnerable, but I can't tell you how grateful I am, and I don't I it's difficult to uh, comprehend obviously for anyone having a, different person in a different, situation but, um I think that's part of the immense, blessing that God has given us is given, us a unique family Dynamic and unique, people with unique strengths that uh has, given us the opportunity to flourish, when it just shouldn't be possible so, um my mom has played such a large role, in that and being able to talk to her, and being an open Communicator with her, um she has largely shaped the way I, communicate and think through things and, why I do have so much grace and, forgiveness because it seems like every, every time I have an issue or some sort, of conflict I can go to her and we can, talk it through and it's not like either, of us will have necessarily the right, answer but we're going to get there, because we can communicate effectively, and we can um put our hearts on the, table and without guards because we both, have the other's best interest at, heart, um and so through that and uh and, through her perseverance it seems like, inhuman um it'll it'll bring me to tears, but, um through seeing her persevere and, forgive time and time again, has has showed me what it what it looks, like to really forgive others and, forgive myself and um have Grace and, compassion T I think obviously you've, had a huge impact on your kids and how, they've been able to process and deal, with all of this and come come out on, the other side and being able to talk, with all three of you has been, absolutely incredible you're amazing, people and you can tell that these kids, come from a great family wonderful, parents a loving mother and just hearing, again that process of forgiveness, McKenna I want to come to you because we, haven't heard from you yet on this how, did the Forgiveness piece of the puzzle, work for you I think it it may have been, a little bit more difficult for me I, think I feel very protective over my, family and that sometimes gets in the, way of my, forgiveness, um the like the guy who killed my dad I, it took me a while to be able to say I, do forgive him but that doesn't mean, that I'm okay with what he did I think, forgiveness is more for ourselves and, saying it's not okay what they did but, it's it's okay for me to let go of it, and I don't have to hold on to, it just because they did that I don't, have to carry it um and I can give it to, God and I know, that it's it's really um amazing that we, can give it to God and that he will take, care of it and that he's in control of, it all he already has the plan I don't, have to do anything with it I don't even, need to carry it at all it does nothing, for me, and um people in our family, too it's that's maybe been a little, harder for me even to forgive because I, feel like, it's it has been hard on my mom and my, brother and, I, and so it's, just it's weird I I, think I just have to let go of it and, say it's not it's not for me to, carry well you know when it comes to, forgiveness sometimes you have to sort, of continue it's a process it's not a, one-time thing I have a number of, friends who have survived really, horrible situations and they've had to, go through forgiveness repeatedly right, it's a process it's a place you need to, be in when something happens there might, be a reminder suddenly of what you went, through the emotions the anger can come, back and so for a lot of people, forgiveness is a journey that you're on, and you have to continue to make sure, that you're not controlled by those, anger and those other emotions as well, um TAA when when you look at Chris's, killing and everything that came after, it how did you, experience that you know how did it, reshape you maybe all the things you, thought you knew about life about, faith it's a great question it it, changed I want to say everything and I, actually think that now when I look back, and and I don't say that lightly I I, remember um driving back from church one, day and just you know we were listening, to worship music and singing and all of, a sudden it just hit me how far I have, come as as a person like I am not who I, was and in my faith in particular it it, made me like really tear up and of just, gratitude and awe and kind of this this, realization of like who I am so changed, and I'm grateful for the change it's one, of those things, where uh you know you don't I guess you, just live your life and you know things, are changing and I had a very I had a, strong sense that I was not going to be, who I would be one day I knew that like, I knew all of this would be changing but, to to come to this place where I've, never been I didn't grow up like this, you know my parents went to church at an, Episcopal church but we weren't, listening to worship music at at home, like we do and I didn't I just um and to, have that with my kids and to see I mean, how incredible they are, that you know and if God had asked me at, the time if God had said t listen you're, going to be a better person like a, you're going to be forged differently, and a better character and you're GNA, know more of me and you're going to be, more faithful and your kids will be, stronger you know we just have to take, Chris I would have said no absolutely, like no I don't I don't want that for, any reason and so I do think it's, interesting how the devil can make a, move and God can just redeem it and not, and just like flood it with goodness, like oh you want to play a game with my, kids like that's what I picture you know, God doing like okay you want to do that, to him go for it because you know what, I'm gonna do I'm gonna you know flood, him with goodness and then you know how, you like me now kind of thing you know I, just I feel like that's um what he did, and I I would trade it I would trade the, for them to not have to go through this, you know pain and the lessons even, knowing that they're set up for Life, probably a lot a lot more than most, people their age because they they're, resilient and they know how to do things, that most people wouldn't know but, um you know they're equipped for life, and you can see that talking to them you, can see that there are some 35 year olds, who are not equipped for life the way, that you know your kids are and that the, two of you are just sitting here being, able to talk with you um and so you know, I want to just talk about Chris's memory, how do you keep Chris's memory alive, it's been 11 years what do you do to, make sure that that he is still a very, much a part of your family yeah it's an, interesting thing I I have I don't know, if it's healthy or not for me personally, but I have very much felt like he was, just a a part of things still and um and, so it's been fairly easy for me to do, that I mean we do have our foundation T, and Chris Kyle Foundation right so his, picture and his name and all that is, there I do still share on social media, things about him so I do that uh with, the kids when I feel something, overwhelmingly like every once in a, while I'll feel something that I just, feel overwhelmed and I'll share it like, I just had this like very strong sense, that dad is very proud of you and I, don't I try to never speak for him I, don't think people should do that Chris, would this I don't know how what you, know I don't know what Chris would do, but on things that I feel very strongly, about I will share that or like the, other day we have a assault gun to like, kill flies you know in the house it's, just like salt PS and Colton got one and, I just had this like thought in my head, I felt like if Chris was over there he, would have pointed it at me and like, shot me in the butt you know with ass, salt thing like just and knowing that I, would come after him and like it would, be on you know like what uh and so every, once in a while I have those feelings, and when I do I just share it with them, and and uh I try not to make a point of, like his birthday or the anniversary of, his death I asked them when they were, little we can do this like we can make a, day of this or we cannot and I can share, it with you or not you know what's the, preference and I think their preference, which I fully support was just days are, hard enough when it like you said it, comes when it comes we don't have to, make a day to feel bad um and so I would, I would just kind of honor him the way I, could um it's just organic I guess, that's a better way to say it we try not, to make it about a certain day a year or, anniversaries as much as just, organically keep him keep him there, Colton for you personally what do you do, that help helps keep your father's, memory alive well obviously I'm working, with American snipers so I'm constantly, thinking of um what he would want and, what he was passionate about how he, lived his life and those kinds of things, and um honoring him in the way, that I know his prior prity because of, my relationship with him as a father, with the time that I did have I know, that his priority would be what I want, and so I'm very grateful for that, freedom uh that that pressure that I, don't have on my shoulders that I need, to make sure I'm doing exactly what he, would want because he would want what I, would want um but in reality it is his, legacy and I'm carrying it on and so, what I get to take from that are what I, believe he was most passionate about and, what was most evident that was passed on, to me and so I get to represent those in, my own way so I have the opportunity and, the platform to step up and say I'm, going to stand for the same things my, father stood for in the way that I stand, for them um and so that's one way um we, we do have some pictures and things like, that around the house I say some we have, we have a few pictures around the house, of him and we can remember him that way, I know like my mom said different people, deal deal with grief different ways and, so for some it's I need it around me all, the time I I need to be reminded and for, some it's I don't want anything I I want, to forget it's even happen so for me I'd, like to see it i' try to see it more, pragmatically he he was here and he did, these things and we need to recognize, those and now he's not here and so what, we get to do is step into this new age, and this new era of our lives and while, remembering what he did do for us and, what he provided and what he taught us, and all of that, so, um I I often wish that I would be able, to have certain conversations with him, and ask him about life experiences and, all manner of things and just talk with, him that's what I miss the most rather, than anything like experiences um but, learning I love to learn um a lot of, thing a lot of things I have a lot of, interest so, that's what I miss the most and and I, think about him often but that gives me, the opportunity to research it and to, ask my mom questions about um memories, and situations that she's been in that, she remembers um and so I get to, appreciate those for what they are but I, don't want to take it so far as, to somehow to be delusional or live in, the past or, um be stuck in a place where I can't, move forward and so kind of that Duality, appreciate what I had and understand, that I don't and move forward in knowing, what I know now and appreciating what I, know now yeah that's a really healthy, way to process everything that's gone on, and and moving forward and just being, able to to to look at it with a healthy, perspective now McKenna I don't want to, speak for you um but but the job that, you want to do right I think about your, father and he was a protector and, everything that he did it's really, interesting to see the parallels there, that want to go and do the job that, you're doing now um and to me it just, seems like one way of of maybe keeping, your father's memory alive in the, passion that you have for that job that, you feel called, to yes sir so I feel like um I feel like, I do less, of carrying on his legacy in the public, I I think i' prefer to leave that more, to my mom and my brother and I think, they do a good job with it and, personally I don't feel like I really, have to try to keep it alive because, it's just we all do have those memories, of him, and we we know what he was like and so, there were times when I was younger that, I got scared that um maybe I'll forget, him someday or maybe I'll forget what he, looked like or things like that but I I, haven't and I won't because he was a big, part of my life and that's not something, that I can forget and I also I'll go, back maybe like once a year and watch, some of his interviews that he did and, stuff like, that and like you said I do feel like um, the way that I somewhat carry on his, legacy is through law enforcement I know, he also he held law enforcement in very, high regards, he said that um they deploy every day, whereas he deployed for months at a time, and so it's just it's cool for me to be, able, to kind of experience what he was, interested in as well and I also get to, share memories with the deputies and, things like that and it's cool because, they they understand and too, and I don't know I just think it's, really cool and also the sheriff was, good friends with my dad and so it's, it's cool in that way as well and she, wears his his dog tags all like 24 hours, a day seven days a week never takes them, off yeah t you obviously have done so, much speaking over the years inspiring, people through the foundation you're, helping people navigate complexities and, relationships in life and and so much, more you know one of the recent things, you did was you put together a, children's book um prayers for bears and, I want to make sure we link out to that, um let people grab that because it's an, important resource for kids and for, families and I love with kids books you, know the kid is learning but the parents, as they're reading it are learning too, so I just want to make sure we put that, out there that you have that book but, what would your final words be um you, just as we sit here today there's so, much we could dig into but I want to, leave people with something powerful, because there's so much to your story, the Redemption and what your family went, through if you could just leave us with, some powerful words today I think if, anything I just hope that people know, when people hear somebody say God is, good or he's always there it can sound, trit if you're really in the middle of a, a storm and yet it is the truth and it's, about giving it time, right that's what I noticed most of all, with God is that the things we live in a, culture where everything's immediate and, God is Not handcuffed to our immediate, culture he will do what he will do and, he will do it in ways that we cannot, imagine usually it's like I always think, of his creativity is infinite so even if, I and I'm imaginative and creative and I, start thinking well he could do this and, he could do that it's like just leave it, I promise like I feel our life at least, has shown me I could not imagine it I, could not plan it and guess what thank, God literally I don't have to and he, will heal you it it does take time, because we're human like we can't absorb, all the things we need to do to heal but, it does happen and so for me it's just I, just want people to know it will happen, even if it's one hour at a time one, Sunset to one Sunrise it does happen you, do you do come out on the other end like, like we have yeah it's so incredible to, see right to see that and to see McKenna, and Colton you've grown up and you're, doing these amazing things and you're in, such a great place and your willingness, to be so vulnerable with us today and to, share with us because I think a lot of, people they don't share they they don't, want to get into those deeper darker, parts of themselves when they go through, something like this and yet this message, is so important for people to hear the, three of you have given us your time and, we're so grateful for that we so, appreciate you joining us today well, thank you very much we appreciate it too, Billy we talked in the beginning about, happy Memorial Day do you want me to, touch on that yeah let's do that before, we go actually because that is important, let's talk about that because people you, know they'll say things like happy, Memorial Day right and there are lots of, barbecues and parties and in the right, context that's okay but let's talk a, little bit about the real meaning of the, day right how can people appropriately, engage engage in the holiday how can, people look at Memorial Day and say, we're going to celebrate this, commemorate this in the right way yes, and so I feel like anytime somebody, sends me a text on Memorial Day happy, Memorial Day I receive it the way I, believe they intended it which is, they're just trying to say I remember, and thank you for your service I I don't, take offense to it I do know a lot of, people who are in the military and do, take offense because they feel like, you're not understanding the meaning if, you're saying happy Memorial I'm, remembering Brothers I lost the sisters, I lost so it's not happy for them and I, I would love for them not to take, offense and just see the intention but I, thought it might be helpful to tell, people instead thinking of you on, Memorial Day you know um I'm hoping this, day brings you you know whatever it is, that you need this year or this time and, and Chris and I we we would go to um, a um Cemetery that would have Warriors, buried there and we would even if we, didn't know anybody or didn't live in a, place where there was somebody close by, we would pray over them we' remember the, people we lost he and then we would and, we would take the kids and say a prayer, there and then we would go out and do, the barbecue and the things the things, they died for to give us freedom to, celebrate so hopefully that helps, somebody out there navigate sort of the, the meaning and the way to maybe even, um you know recognize the day yeah you, know pausing to reflect being able to be, thankful understanding the loss that, people were willing, to go through right not just the, individuals themselves but their, families giving themselves up for, freedom and there's so many loved ones, and family members who mourn that loss, and obviously are are proud of their, loved ones but this can be a tough time, I would imagine of year for some people, and here we are we we get to enjoy these, freedoms because of what people were, willing to do that's what the day, actually means and I think a lot of, people they get confused between, Veterans Day and Memorial Day um so, maybe just briefly help people, understand the difference between the, two so that that confusion um is cleared, up a little bit you know it's a very, good point we do and it's easy to do but, yeah so veterans it's like you know, thank you and we're celebrating your, service and we're grateful and and, Memorial Day really was to set to say, let's take a day to remember how many, people have died for our freedom and so, the Memorial Day thing is for many, veterans you know they really they think, about it often but they will set that, side day aside to really, remember witnessing the death of their, friends you know seeing other people, they didn't know carried off it is a is, a very traumatic thing for them to, remember and so veterans are alive and, living and we're appreciative and then, Memorial Day is who died on the, battlefield you know who who lost their, life because of the fight yeah and, another thing I would add just one more, thing you know praying for the loved, ones and the family members who are, grieving those who you know who are left, behind they're grieving their loved ones, who have passed away I think uh we don't, often think about that but Memorial Day, is a great time to be reflecting and, even making a list of the people around, you who you know who may be mourning who, may be grieving and and praying for them, that's important for us to be doing and, and I really appreciate you taking the, time again to break everything down for, us today to speak with us about your, story thank you all it was an honor to, speak with you too thanks absolutely it, was a pleasure thank you very much","shortTranscript":"you know there are some dads and we all, know them where it's like they have they, expect that their son does exactly what, they did or or does exactly what they, feel is best and they want to sort of, guide it but we even when the kids were, little we talked about how it's God's, calling on their life not ours and um, and know Colton with American sniper in, particular he's kind of pulled it into, like seven qualities that he shares with, his dad that he's really passionate, about and I often think I mean we were, talking to Marcus Latrell too the Lone, Survivor and he was saying the same, thing like he he doesn't expect his kids, to serve in the military you know if, they want to and that's where they're, called great and if they don't they, don't but it's um I think Chris would be, really proud that Colton's making his, own way and that McKenna is not doing, things you know the way everybody else, does either they're just kind of forging, their own path I think he he'd really, like that"},{"file":"result-The Washington

to be a part of, that it's, uh I haven't come to grips with it it, doesn't feel um real because when you're, auditioning for projects uh in my mind, anyway because you go through so many, rejections and then bookings if you're, lucky decent amount of bookings and uh, and to assume that it's something that's, going to be big or people are going to, even want to watch it it's not something, that usually goes on in my head, especially when it came to you know the, chosen is when I was first casting it I, turned it down about three times I did, not want to do a religious project I was, just gonna say why I was gonna say why, but you just you did you weren't, interested it wasn't something that was, on your radar for wanting to do no no no, no no especially to play a guy in his, mid-50s was a fisherman and I thought, okay this is not going to be a serious, project they would never cast somebody, was in their late 30s to play you know a, 50-some year old guy and uh but yeah man, it's been uh it's it's been it's been, mind-blowing I mean it's it's so out of, your hands it's so out of your hands how, somebody receives something and so uh, you're always grateful when it happens, it's just this I'm both it's been a, combination of being shocked and, grateful and uh mind blown yeah yeah, well so what was it for you you know you, rejected it a number of times what made, you say finally okay fine I'm going to, do this well it was interesting because, I was recording Care Bears at the time, the animated series and I I still had my, part-time retail job and so the, compromise was I told agent at the time, if both of these jobs will let me off, the hook to be in Texas in late November, for 2 and a half 3 weeks which you know, retail time that's never going to happen, that's like the prime time that's yeah, you got Thanksgiving Christmas Hanukkah, all these different they're just not, going to do that and uh and so I'm done, with the record at Care Bears and I go, up to um Mara Goodman she's the voice, director of the original Care Bears like, I she calls herself my Jewish mom so I, went up to her I'm like hey uh JM I got, a question in GM Jewish mom and she said, yeah what's up great work today I was, like oh thank you um I didn't want to do, it so I was egging her on as I asked her, so I was like there's this um Jesus, project that they want me to do and uh, if you don't want me to go I'd have to, miss like a few episodes of Care Bears, and it's okay I'll tell them I can't do, it and literally this look washed over, her face where she was just kind of, Frozen in time for a few, seconds and was just leading in going, what what's going on she snaps out of it, turns to me and goes yeah you should go, it sounds like a good opportunity I was, like what it was not the answer I, wanted and not the answer you were, expecting obviously no and I said what, do you mean go she said go I'm like yeah, but I'd be missing a few episodes so you, can make it up when you come back just, go are you serious I go to work that, evening to my part-time retail job pull, my manager's side into the office tell, him the same thing and I said look man, like same expression wash over face I'm, like what is going on, today SS out it looks at me and he says, yeah you should go it sounds like a, great opportunity he says the exact same, thing wow I'm like what and I said wild, schedule for the next you know the, schedule is two weeks ahead of time and, I'm on like four days a week I can't, give out like 10 11 12 shifts that's too, fast and then he responds with pH, freezes, again it's okay I'll just take you off, the, shifts I like what so there was no way, out of this for you I, mean you basically because you said if, these two things line up I'll do it they, line up and you do it were you still, reluctant at that point in light of what, the project was oh bro I was on the, airplane flying to Texas looking out the, window to the clouds mumbling to myself, I can't believe I'm going to go play a, 55-year-old fisherman in this religious, project Yep this is what it's come to, this is the final nail in the acting, career yep here we are we've, arrived and now and the funny part is, here you are right and you never could, have imagined that playing zebede and, being part of this series would have it, would have been this massive I mean, there are very I can't think of another, show that's anything like the chosen in, terms of the fandom and the growth of it, no not at all you can't imagine it and, and if I'm being honest, um ever since you know ever since I've, had my own encounter with God in Texas, at at the tail end of season 3 um H I, don't, really I'm thankful but I I, don't I feel like there's nothing left, at stake in this life for me as in I'm, thankful for everything but I'm not, like there's nothing at stake for it, blowing up the way it is or you know the, praise that's coming in for zebedy and, I'm more excited the way it's been, touching people rather than oh this is, something that's going to benefit me uh, yeah God came and burned all of that, away I was gonna say that that guy on, the plane mumbling to himself about this, and the guy you are now I mean let's, let's get into that because that you're, you becoming a Christian encountering, Jesus has been a story that has been out, there um people have been talking about, it and it's interesting before we talk, about the moment that you had as you, said at the end of season 3 um in real, life what what for you would you say how, did you process Jesus like if somebody, came up to you before you started on the, Chosen and said who's Jesus what does, faith mean to you what would you have, said what I and I've said this before, actually my my grandfather was a Greek, priest and so to me growing up around, him um I was about 6 and a half years, old when I was born in Beirut Lebanon so, he was a Greek priest over there Greek, Orthodox and family immigrated to the, Bay Area because of the Civil War that, was going on so we we were a Christian, household I mean grandfather was a Greek, priest and so the way I'd answer people, is well my bridge to to God and to Jesus, has always been my grandfather he has, been the bridge um in the sense of, although he was doing it within a, religious confine he walked the walk of, Jesus Christ, he he would sweep the church himself, after service was over and then I would, hear stories of him going door Todo, anointing people in their homes because, he felt like he was on a genuine, spiritual mission to do the work of what, God wanted him to do so that was always, my bridge and and I always believed he, he left something on me before he passed, away and I've always been connected in, that way in that I had Faith but it, would you know it would waver here and, there because I never had my own, personal experience I guess you could, say with God like I didn't like like now, I say like no I know the guy but before, I didn't really know the guy I knew him, through my grandfather because my, grandfather was such a prime example of, um what it was to to to to follow Jesus, he lived he lived it and he didn't even, have to really say much um like he, wasn't a blabber mouth like me he, just you know you can say you can say, you're a Christian right and then you, can be a Christian and those are often, especially in in our culture very, different things right you know 60 60 to, 70% of the population says they're a, Christian I don't know what percentage, actually is right but those are those, are different things and I think a lot, of people that resonates with because, they understand what that's like to say, it but you had this encounter you know, with God that sounds when when I've, heard you talk about it very different, from anything you had happened before, take us through that yeah yeah um it's, interesting and I and I'll I'll try and, make it as concise and short as possible, because it's this is very long but I I, show up to the apartments in Texas they, set us up in these beautiful apartments, with cooking utensils and everything, while we're inex Texas and it's it's, great I geek out over this stuff and um, I unpack everything I'm walking around, the apartment and literally all of a, sudden and this is how you know God's, been in hindsight just constantly trying, to download stuff to me it's like, somebody beamed a projector from my, right shoulder and left into the ceiling, where I saw a gilded cage encrusted with, diamonds and rubies and and just like, floral design all over this cage with a, key and a door and there was just people, in Silhouettes all around the cage, applauding and they had kind of like a, smile like the Joker did it looked kind, of disturbing and then a secondary image, projected onto the ceiling of this dirt, road white dirt road with Green Pastures, and a blue sky in the Sun and I was like, whoa what the heck is this why am I why, am I being shown this right now this is, weird and no matter where I walked, around in the apartment the projections, wouldn't go away, and I'm like am I supposed to pick one, and then I strongly heard you're at a, crossroads right now you're at a fork in, the road and you can, have one of these and you've got to pick, one I'm like pick one what what is going, on I'm like I'm looking at this gilded, cage which was like worth millions of, dollars bro like the most beautiful pure, gold that you've ever seen in your life, and and and then I looked at everybody, applauding around the, cage and something just got Twisted in, my gut and it felt, wrong and I thought okay if if I go this, direction I will, never I will never get to be me again, I'm going to have to create an image of, myself as an, actor and almost like these people are, worshiping when I step in this like this, is weird like and by the way I haven't, really read the Bible at this point, either so I'm just seen all this and I, got so upset and I started just bashing, the cage in my mind and then I turned to, the left and I went okay uh I want, whatever this is it looks kind of boring, but I want, this and then it literally went Z it, went away as soon as I picked it and at, that point I just started kind of, calling out to God in the apartment I, just you know when something ignites in, you it's not even you speaking it's, something deeper and and I said God I, said you know what I've decided, I want a huge life I want to live large, but not with material things not with, cars my soul is crying out for something, bigger I want to live large and that was, the beginning of season 3 next thing I, know I'm making friends on set with, construction workers who are some of the, lead construction workers and um, starting to meet people outside the set, who are believers and uh they set an, example that was too disarming to to, deny in the sense of well wait a, second I've never been around, Christians the term we talk about to, Christ I've never been around Christians, like this these guys are these guys are, a little, off like is it g to be true you know, yeah and when I'm around them I get a, little dizzy like I feel like a wave is, constantly hitting my face why are it's, like there was this undescribable, brightness around them, but I knew even though I thought that, was weird and for my taste they were way, too into Jesus like way too into him but, I kept wanting to hang out with him I, kept being compelled and magnetized okay, I guess I'll go to lunch with him again, or I go here I'll go there which, accumulated to be invited towards the, tail end of season 3 to uh a conference, this church called Mercy culture in, Texas was thrown this conference and the, two or our two uh kind of lead, um blueprint construction guys they, invited me when they saw me talking to, some of their workers about my, grandfather and I'm like uh what is that, what kind of church conference and, they're like will we get together will, we pray and you know it's in the name of, Jesus and I'm like let me think about it, and then I had a change of heart and I, was like you know what no no no no no, I'll come I was like how much is it, they're like they look at each other and, Brandon and Seth these two their, brother-in-laws and they turned to me, and they go we think you should just, come don't worry about paying I'm like n, no if it's a church thing like I'm going, to give money like I'm not going to, don't C my ticket it's fine they're like, no no no no no we think you really have, to come you should, come and it felt very Stern and loving, and direct and I thought okay fine I'll, come yeah so I mean next thing I know I, was there my head down everybody's like, doing ballet swirls around me in this uh, I've never been around people that were, that loving in the sense of it wasn't, coming from Human love it was coming, from God love and they were just, unapologetically in love with Jesus I, guess at the time and I thought wow what, a bunch of weirdos and I'm, just I'm looking around trying to make, sense of it I'm I'm assuming you're, sitting there wondering I don't know, what I'm looking at what in the world is, this but there's I it's like you want to, keep watching it and experiencing it, yeah and I'm I'm being judgmental in my, mind because at that point I was you, know before I went to the conference I, was driving a set and all of a sudden uh, to to eat to join the casting crew for, meals I wasn't scheduled to work, um but a black hole opened up in me and, it started to swallow me kind of like, venom style and I thought what's going, on and that night was the church, conference event and my heart spoke up, and said if you don't ask God for help, right now this is about to get bad and I, thought what it was just swallowing me, alive next thing I knew I screamed out, while I'm driving through the you know, Midlothian Hillside God my soul is lost, and at that point it felt like my brain, was a egg in a microwave and it's, like I just started screaming and crying, and I said God my soul's been lost for a, long time and I need you now and not, only do I need you I need what you and, Jesus have to offer I was like and by, the way what's with this Holy Spirit, thing I'm sick of hearing about all this, I want you I don't want religion I don't, want a leader telling me about you I, don't want to hear about you come on bro, like it was like that it was like I was, challenging him to show himself, desperately out of, desperation and it was crazy and I I go, to the conference that night completely, disarmed and um yeah next thing I know, nine people I have have their hands over, me and um towards the end of it they're, just you know they're they're praying in, their spiritual language and it felt, like and I've told some of my relatives, this and they're like oh well you know, you you experienced an epiphany and all, these things I was like no no no no no I, felt from the outside like a meteor that, hits the planet kind of like you know um, Armageddon I felt like a meteor hit my, body and from the bottom of my feet the, fire just started building to the top, and then by the time it reached my head, I almost was going to run out because I, felt the sensation of passing away I, felt what it was like to die wow what I, it's just and I don't want to use the, word feeling in the sense of I felt the, sensation of passing away and I thought, oh my gosh I'm dying and in my mind I, could hear voes going get out of here, this is a cult you need to leave right, now and in my heart I felt the deep, voice coming to say no no no no no stay, let it happen, stay and then next thing I knew um it, was like a nuclear reactor was shoved in, my stomach and it was like v v v v, vom every single organ was being burned, away to where I felt emptied out like I, was literally operating on what God put, in me the and I stopped and everybody, took their hands off me they're all, staring at me like I'm the freak, now and I I turn to all of them I'm like, what like what are you looking act and, then I I went whoa I can hear myself, talk I'm like, whoa it was like I was operating my body, for the first time like everything felt, brand new immediately you felt a a, relief in a different Spirit within your, you felt like a different person dude, like a like it was me but it wasn't me, anymore, and you know 15 years of letdowns and, emotional trauma like it was wiped out, within two minutes and I'm like, searching wait a second where's the, anger where's the I was like what did, you guys do to me they're like you, receive the Holy Spirit and I said no no, no my grandfather baptized me when I was, a baby in Lebanon like he was a priest, they're like yeah it was probably, resting on you but now he's in you and, since then it's been, uh well you know I got to tell you the, fact that you're so openly because there, are a lot of people who they will have, experiences like this and they will not, talk about it especially when they're in, a public role you know they they hold, back on it you have very boldly, shared this story and I want to hear, more about how you've changed but before, before that I do want to commend you for, talking about it because it's something, that can help other people and change, other people's lives hearing what you, have experienced and gone through why, have you been so open about it is that, why, you you you touched on it um once it had, happened and I I went back to California, literally four days later I was flown, back and I had say goodbye to all these, new friends and it was heartbreaking for, me because I'd never been around people, outside of my family that is that cared, so much in a genuine way and all I did, was spend time with God for, like before I came back to Texas that's, all I did, so I felt very, I don't know I felt very strongly, compelled to I kept hearing you have to, tell everybody what happened even if it, ruins quote unquote your acting career, you have to tell you have to tell and it, wasn't coming from like a thought it was, just an order a directive you have to, tell what happened and then I started, getting, images of people all around me graying, out and disintegrating and scales coming, off and they were dying and I thought, okay like I'm at a place now where it's, like I can either talk about my acting, career all the time or I could talk, about, this and that strong strong feeling, of I have to share this, because after everything that, everybody's been through these past, couple of years and all the darkness, that seems to be creeping into the, world it's, like I'm giv this not the gilded cage, platform but I I picked the, open the open Pasture Road and all these, incredible people that went out of their, way to pour into me and I I met God like, I met the creator of the whole freaking, universe and so now what I keep this to, myself oh well you you should just set a, good example by not saying it and just, well it's not me that's saying this I'm, being compelled to talk about it why, wouldn't I mean it wouldn't make sense, for me to to do any of this if I wasn't, compelled to talk about it especially, you know as an actor where you're, supposed to maintain this neutral you, know non you know confrontational stance, but but I've had so many encounters with, him since then that it's like I can't, sweep what he did under the rug like and, and I'm I don't come from a place of, trying to offend anyone or hurt anyone, but it's like the way I see it as it is, what it is and it did happen and it, wasn't an epiphany that I had and it, wasn't a well it was you know the, universe that did this no it it's this, isn't even nothing compared to the, encounters I've had these past couple of, months so it was the uh no no no I did, this to you because you are going to go, tell everyone and even if it means, ruining your career and I I heard that, and I felt that strongly, And I said Okay God okay like you gave, me this brand new life and uh and I'm, not perfect I'm not this righteous holy, person and a lot of people get that, wrong about people that have been, encountered by God and that taught me to, not be judgmental as well because all, these people that I've made friends with, who've been encountered and have the, presence of the Holy Spirit around them, and in them they told me some crazy Back, stories of their lives where I did not, believe they were who they were so yeah, well I I appreciate you sharing this I, have about a thousand more questions for, you but I have to let you go to another, interview and we're gonna have to talk, more uh because this is incredible and, appreciate you sharing by by sharing it, you are helping other people find the, truth and that is incredible and, appreciate your your testimony and your, work on the chosen","shortTranscript":"you know it would waver here and there, because I never had my own, personal experience I guess you could, say with God like I didn't like like now, I say

about Joe, Biden and I'm, just ripping the Band-Aid off um because, I think that it's really important that, people, get the straight, truth and I feel like there has been a, lot of smoke screens that have been, going on about this we saw what 2 3, weeks ago now uh the president debated, Donald Trump and that, debate sucked okay going into the debate, I'm pretty sure a lot of people knew, that the president is old president is, very, old um Donald Trump is also very old and, a racist and a Neo-Nazi but anyways I'm, not even going to talk about Trump right, now in the country that we live in we, have everyday people and we have voters, and we, have government and then you kind of, have this class of people in between, from pundits and media and wealthy, people and donors this class of donors, decision makers Power Players, Etc start started to waver after the, debate and they're looking at the, polling and they're they're looking at, the performance and they're saying all, of these things and they're saying we, need to jump ship if, personally people want to have this, conversation 6 months ago 8 months ago a, year ago it's a very different landscape, but this whole class of people who are, coming with this other opinion now have, supported the president, the entire time and many of those people, are the same people who closed ranks, around anybody who even wanted to raise, this conversation a year ago I think, people need to understand the reality, and the gravity of what is being what, these people are, proposing the Democratic Convention is, in what four weeks or, so um the the state of Ohio has legal, ballot access issues that require a name, to be enrolled and certified on their, ballot even before the, convention that's what's at the table, and guess what Republicans they mount, that legal, challenge the possibility of, our elections being decided by a Supreme, Court ruling Skyrocket, you have an open convention the, convention could then go on for days if, you have a bunch of nominees and then, before you know it you blow past the, Michigan deadline if you don't have a, nominee in two days or whatever it may, be and then we start the legal problems, start to mount over the last several, weeks there have been lots of, Democrats who have, been giving little Anonymous quotes, to the press to some journalists that's,  like if you have an opinion say, it with your chest and say it in public, then there was recently a quote unquote, senior Democratic leader that said oh um, we I'm just resigning myself to a trump, Victory leave your seat leave if you, think that there is, consensus among the people who want Joe, Biden to leave that Kamala that they, will support Kamala vice president, Harris you would be mistaken I see what, they say in, conversations a lot of them are not just, interested in, removing the, president they are interested in, removing the whole ticket there is a war, chest of at least $100 million prepared, for the general election if there is a, new Democratic, nominee that money cannot be transferred, I have not, seen a, scenario an alternative scenario that I, feel does not set us up for enormous, Peril there is no safe option, if you are the kind of politician that, wants genuinely wants to be president of, the United, States a lot of those folks don't want, that they don't want to be shoed in 8, weeks before an election starts because, let me tell you something people think, this election is in November the, convention is in four weeks and early, ballots go out the first early ballots, in this country go out four weeks after, that this election is not in November, it's in September my community does not, have the luxury of accepting loss in, July of an election year everybody is,

Maine..., without adding tons of emissions \nwith shipping?, That is, if you didn't know that seaweed \nis super heavy when wet., But once we figure out the logistics, \nit's over., We solved it., The cows are content and \nthe planet is saved., Except not at all, obviously., For one, this doesn't appear to be \na one size fits all solution., Recently, another Australian study, found that the same red seaweed only cut \nmethane emissions by under 30%., Now, granted, that's still a reduction, \nwhich is good news, but may be less of a miracle \nthan we hoped., Others are urging researchers \nto slow down on red seaweed, because of the bromoform ., In it’s pure form, \nthe EPA has reported, that it could be dangerous \nto human health, if ingested., Luckily, studies so far haven't found \nthat at dangerous levels in milk, or in meat from cows eating \nthe seaweed additive., But studies still need to be done , on how it might affect \nthe cows long term., So it's not a silver bullet..., but thankfully seaweed’s \nnot our only option., I think this is just one of several solutions, that are being looked at \nat the moment., And overall, there's a big push for change., In 2021, 150 countries, \nincluding the United States, signed the United Nations \nGlobal Methane Pledge..., which aims to reduce methane emissions \nby 30% by 2030., It's becoming more and more clear now \nthat we won't get there..., unless we tackle enteric \nmethane emissions., In an ideal world, \nwe'd have less livestock., But getting people to change their habits, isn't always the most straightforward \nor quickest solution., The work of searching for solutions\nto the climate crisis, needs to be multifaceted., Within a year or two, \nyou will see quite, a lot of different activities \nand different solutions., That's going to come up., And that could be one less \ncow burp at a time.","shortTranscript":"there are about 1.5 billion cows on this, planet that's one cow
